Task: Build a Question Answering pipeline without Elasticsearch
===============================================================

Haystack provides alternatives to Elasticsearch for developing quick
prototypes.

You can use an ``InMemoryDocumentStore`` or a
``SQLDocumentStore``\ (with SQLite) as the document store.

If you are interested in more feature-rich Elasticsearch, then please
refer to the Tutorial 1.

.. code:: ipython3

    ! pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git
    #! pip install farm-haystack

.. code:: ipython3

    from haystack import Finder
    from haystack.indexing.cleaning import clean_wiki_text
    from haystack.indexing.utils import convert_files_to_dicts, fetch_archive_from_http
    from haystack.reader.farm import FARMReader
    from haystack.reader.transformers import TransformersReader
    from haystack.utils import print_answers

Document Store
--------------

.. code:: ipython3

    # In-Memory Document Store
    from haystack.database.memory import InMemoryDocumentStore
    document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()

.. code:: ipython3

    # SQLite Document Store
    # from haystack.database.sql import SQLDocumentStore
    # document_store = SQLDocumentStore(url="sqlite:///qa.db")

Cleaning & indexing documents
-----------------------------

Haystack provides a customizable cleaning and indexing pipeline for
ingesting documents in Document Stores.

In this tutorial, we download Wikipedia articles on Game of Thrones,
apply a basic cleaning function, and index them in Elasticsearch.

.. code:: ipython3

    # Let's first get some documents that we want to query
    # Here: 517 Wikipedia articles for Game of Thrones
    doc_dir = "data/article_txt_got"
    s3_url = "https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/deepset.ai-farm-qa/datasets/documents/wiki_gameofthrones_txt.zip"
    fetch_archive_from_http(url=s3_url, output_dir=doc_dir)
    
    # convert files to dicts containing documents that can be indexed to our datastore
    # You can optionally supply a cleaning function that is applied to each doc (e.g. to remove footers)
    # It must take a str as input, and return a str.
    dicts = convert_files_to_dicts(dir_path=doc_dir, clean_func=clean_wiki_text, split_paragraphs=True)
    
    # We now have a list of dictionaries that we can write to our document store.
    # If your texts come from a different source (e.g. a DB), you can of course skip convert_files_to_dicts() and create the dictionaries yourself.
    # The default format here is: {"name": "<some-document-name>, "text": "<the-actual-text>"}
    
    # Let's have a look at the first 3 entries:
    print(dicts[:3])
    # Now, let's write the docs to our DB.
    document_store.write_documents(dicts)


.. parsed-literal::

    04/28/2020 15:06:07 - INFO - haystack.indexing.io -   Found data stored in `data/article_txt_got`. Delete this first if you really want to fetch new data.
    04/28/2020 15:06:07 - INFO - haystack.indexing.io -   Wrote 517 docs to DB


Initalize Retriever, Reader, & Finder
-------------------------------------

Retriever
~~~~~~~~~

Retrievers help narrowing down the scope for the Reader to smaller units
of text where a given question could be answered.

With InMemoryDocumentStore or SQLDocumentStore, you can use the
TfidfRetriever. For more retrievers, please refer to the tutorial-1.

.. code:: ipython3

    # An in-memory TfidfRetriever based on Pandas dataframes
    
    from haystack.retriever.sparse import TfidfRetriever
    retriever = TfidfRetriever(document_store=document_store)


.. parsed-literal::

    04/28/2020 15:07:34 - INFO - haystack.retriever.tfidf -   Found 2811 candidate paragraphs from 517 docs in DB


Reader
~~~~~~

A Reader scans the texts returned by retrievers in detail and extracts
the k best answers. They are based on powerful, but slower deep learning
models.

Haystack currently supports Readers based on the frameworks FARM and
Transformers. With both you can either load a local model or one from
Hugging Face’s model hub (https://huggingface.co/models).

**Here:** a medium sized RoBERTa QA model using a Reader based on FARM
(https://huggingface.co/deepset/roberta-base-squad2)

**Alternatives (Reader):** TransformersReader (leveraging the
``pipeline`` of the Transformers package)

**Alternatives (Models):**
e.g. “distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad” (fast) or
“deepset/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-squad2” (good accuracy)

**Hint:** You can adjust the model to return “no answer possible” with
the no_ans_boost. Higher values mean the model prefers “no answer
possible”

FARMReader
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: ipython3

    # Load a  local model or any of the QA models on
    # Hugging Face's model hub (https://huggingface.co/models)
    
    reader = FARMReader(model_name_or_path="deepset/roberta-base-squad2", use_gpu=False)


.. parsed-literal::

    04/28/2020 15:07:54 - INFO - farm.utils -   device: cpu n_gpu: 0, distributed training: False, automatic mixed precision training: None


TransformersReader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: ipython3

    # Alternative:
    # reader = TransformersReader(model="distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad", tokenizer="distilbert-base-uncased", use_gpu=-1)

Finder
~~~~~~

The Finder sticks together reader and retriever in a pipeline to answer
our actual questions.

.. code:: ipython3

    finder = Finder(reader, retriever)

Voilà! Ask a question!
----------------------

.. code:: ipython3

    # You can configure how many candidates the reader and retriever shall return
    # The higher top_k_retriever, the better (but also the slower) your answers. 
    prediction = finder.get_answers(question="Who is the father of Arya Stark?", top_k_retriever=10, top_k_reader=5)

Arya Stark of House Stark is the younger daughter and third child of Lord Eddard and Catelyn Stark of Winterfell. Ever the tomboy, Arya would rather be training to use weapons than sewing with a needle. She names her direwolf Nymeria, after a legendary warrior queen.
             2210  2d9538e229b8272de9b6f74bf8cdd270  \n====Season 8====\nArya reunites with Jon, Gendry, and the Hound, who have all journeyed to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen's forces to make a stand against the approaching White Walkers. Arya asks Gendry, who is forging dragonglass into weapons, to make her a special dragonglass staff. When Gendry gives it to Arya, he tells her he is the bastard son of Robert Baratheon. Aware of their chances of dying in the upcoming battle and Arya wanting to experience sex, Arya and Gendry sleep together. Later that night, Arya hears the signal alerting her that the White Walkers' army has arrived.\nArya fights in the battle against the dead with Sandor Clegane and Beric Dondarrion. Beric sacrifices himself to allow Arya and the Hound to escape the wights. A battered Arya sprints through the corridors of Winterfell and encounters Melisandre, who suggests to Arya that she is meant to kill the Night King. In the Godswood, just as the Night King is about to kill Bran, Arya sneaks up and stabs the Night King with the Valyrian steel dagger Bran gave her. Upon killing the Night King, the White Walkers and wights are all destroyed. \nIn the aftermath of the battle, Arya is proposed to by Gendry, who had just been legitimised as a Baratheon by Daenerys. Arya declines, as she does not want the life of a lady. Sansa and Arya tell Jon they don't trust Daenerys, but Jon defends her. Arya learns that Jon is the son of her aunt, Lyanna Stark, and Rhaegar Targaryen after Jon swears her and Sansa to secrecy about his true parentage.\nArya journeys south to King's Landing with the Hound to kill Cersei. The two infiltrate the Red Keep with the civilians Cersei is using to deter Daenerys' attack. Despite the city's surrender to Daenerys, she begins laying waste to the populace atop of Drogon. In his mission for revenge against his brother, the Mountain, the Hound seeks out the Mountain but urges Arya to leave and give up her quest for revenge to avoid a life consumed by it. Arya thanks the Hound, calling him by his name for the first time. She tries and fails to save the smallfolk, narrowly avoiding being incinerated in Daenerys' attack on the city, but survives. In the aftermath, Arya is reunited with Jon and warns him that he and the Starks are not safe from Daenerys. Jon tries but is unable to dissuade Daenerys from further destruction and ultimately assassinates her. He is imprisoned. Weeks later, Arya joins the other lords and ladies of Westeros in a council to decide who shall lead the Seven Kingdoms. Bran is chosen as king, though Arya abstains from voting as Sansa declares the North's independence. Arya, Sansa, and Bran bid Jon farewell as he is exiled. \nArya reveals that she is leaving Westeros to see what lies west of the continent. She embarks on her voyage aboard a Stark ship.

Before their departure, Arya's half-brother Jon Snow gifts Arya a sword which she dubs "Needle". On the Kingsroad, Arya is sparring with a butcher's boy, Mycah, when Sansa's betrothed Prince Joffrey Baratheon attacks Mycah, prompting Arya's direwolf Nymeria to bite Joffrey. Arya shoos Nymeria away so she is not killed, but is furious when Sansa later refuses to support her version of events. Mycah is later killed by Joffrey's bodyguard Sandor "The Hound" Clegane, earning him Arya's hatred. Ned arranges for Arya to have sword lessons with the Braavosi Syrio Forel, who later defends her from Ser Meryn Trant after Joffrey ascends to the throne and kills the Stark household. Arya flees the Red Keep, accidentally killing a stable boy in her escape, hiding out as a beggar in the streets of King's Landing. Ned is eventually taken to the Great Sept of Baelor to face judgment; he spots Arya in the crowd, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her presence. Yoren prevents Arya from witnessing Ned's execution and has her pose as a boy, "Arry", to avoid detection as she joins Yoren's recruits traveling north to Castle Black.

While Joffrey and Sansa are walking through the woods, Joffrey notices Arya sparring with the butcher's boy, Mycah. A fight breaks out and Joffrey is attacked by Nymeria (Arya's direwolf) after Joffrey threatens to hurt Arya. Sansa lies to King Robert about the circumstances of the fight in order to protect both Joffrey and her sister Arya.  Since Arya ran off with her wolf to save it, Sansa's wolf is killed instead, estranging the Stark daughters.\nDuring the Tourney of the Hand to honour her father Lord Eddard Stark, Sansa Stark is enchanted by the knights performing in the event.  At the request of his mother, Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey spends a portion of the tourney with Sansa, but near the end he commands his guard Sandor Clegane, better known as The Hound, to take her back to her quarters. Sandor explains how his older brother, Gregor, aka "Mountain that Rides" pushed his face into a brazier of hot coals, for playing with one of his wooden toys.\nAfter Eddard discovers the truth of Joffrey's paternity, he tells Sansa that they will be heading back to Winterfell. Sansa is devastated and wishes to stay in King's Landing, so she runs off to inform Queen Cersei of her father's plans, unwittingly providing Cersei with the information needed to arrest her father. After Robert dies, Sansa begs Joffrey to show mercy on her father and he agrees, if Ned will swear an oath of loyalty, but executes him anyway, in front of Sansa.  Sansa is now effectively a hostage in King's Landing and finally sees Joffrey's true nature, after he forces her to look at the tarred head of her now-deceased father.

She tells Arya that, thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking her out of the acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, the Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya extinguishes the candle lighting the room; having trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya has the upper hand.\nAt the House of Black and White, Jaqen follows a bloodtrail to the Hall of Faces, where he finds the Waif's face before being held at sword-point by Arya. Jaqen congratulates Arya for finally becoming No One. However, she rejects the title, asserting her identity as Arya Stark before turning and leaving, announcing that she is "going home."

She travels with her father, Eddard, to King's Landing when he is made Hand of the King. Before she leaves, her half-brother Jon Snow has a smallsword made for her as a parting gift, which she names "Needle" after her least favorite ladylike activity.\nWhile taking a walk together, Prince Joffrey and her sister Sansa happen upon Arya and her friend, the low-born butcher apprentice Mycah, sparring in the woods with broomsticks.  Arya defends Mycah from Joffrey's torments and her direwolf Nymeria helps Arya fight off Joffrey, wounding his arm in the process.  Knowing that Nymeria will likely be killed in retribution, Arya chases her wolf away; but Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed in Nymeria's stead and Mycah is hunted down and killed by Sandor Clegane, Joffrey's bodyguard.\nIn King's Landing, her father discovers Arya's possession of Needle, but instead of confiscating it he arranges for fencing lessons under the Braavosi swordmaster Syrio Forel, who teaches her the style of fighting known as "water dancing".  After her father's arrest, Syrio is killed protecting her and Arya narrowly escapes capture.  She later witnesses the public execution of her father before falling under the protection of the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren.

Arya then journeys south, intending to travel to King's Landing to assassinate Cersei (now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon). However, Arya changes her mind after learning from Hot Pie that Jon has ousted House Bolton from Winterfell and has been crowned King in the North, and decides to return to her ancestral home. Along the way she encounters a wolf pack led by her long-lost direwolf Nymeria. Nymeria recognizes Arya, but she has grown feral and ignores Arya when she asks her to come North with her.\nArriving at Winterfell, Arya finds that Jon has traveled to Dragonstone but is reunited with Sansa and Bran. Bran reveals his knowledge of Arya's kill list through greenseeing and presents her with a Valyrian steel dagger, which had been given to him by Littlefinger. Arya is also reunited with Brienne, who continues to serve the Starks, and manages to equal the female warrior during sparring despite her smaller size.\nLittlefinger seeks to increase his influence on Sansa by driving a wedge between the Stark sisters. To this end, he allows Arya to witness him receiving a confidential message obtained from Maester Luwin's records. Arya breaks into Littlefinger's quarters to steal the message, which is a plea sent by Sansa following Ned's imprisonment to Robb imploring him to bend the knee to Joffrey. Outraged, Arya confronts Sansa and is unconvinced by her explanation that she did so to try and save Ned's life. Later, Arya catches Sansa looking at her collection of faces and threatens Sansa before leaving. Some time later, Sansa summons Arya to the great hall and begins an accusation of treason and murder; however, the accusation is directed towards Littlefinger, whose crimes have been discovered by Bran's greenseeing. Despite Littlefinger's pleas for mercy, Sansa sentences Littlefinger to death and Arya cuts his throat with the Valyrian steel dagger. The Stark sisters later resolve their differences, and acknowledge that the Starks must stay together to survive winter.
