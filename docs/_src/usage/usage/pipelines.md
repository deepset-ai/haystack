# Pipelines


<div class="recommendation">

The new Pipelines class was added in Haystack 0.6.0 to give a more flexible way of defining your processing steps. 
It replaces the Finder class which will be deprecated in the next version.

Comprehensive guides and documentation coming soon! 
For now, have a look at our [latest release notes](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/releases/tag/v0.6.0) to see what is possible.
You can also refer to our [Pipelines API documentation](/docs/latest/apipipelinesmd).
