# :computer: How to update docs?

## Overview and Usage

We moved the Overview and Usage docs to the [haystack-website](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-website) repository. You will find the docs in the folder `docs`. Please make sure to only edit the latest version of the docs. We will release the docs together with the Haystack version. 
We are open for contributions to our documentation. Please make sure to check our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). You will find a step by step introduction to our docs [here](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-website/tree/source).

## Tutorials

The Tutorials live in the folder `tutorials`. 
They are created as colab notebooks which can be used by users to explore new haystack features. 
To include tutorials into the documentation website, markdowns files need to be generated from the notebook. 
There is a Github action that regenerates the markdown file with each commit. 
This can also be done manually by running the script `/docs/_src/tutorials/tutorials/convert_ipynb.py`. 
Furthermore, plaese make sure to update the `headers.py` file with headers for the new tutorials. 
These headers are important for the docs website workflow. 
After the markdown files are generated successfully, you can raise a PR. 
We will review it and as soon as the markdown file is merged to master, it will automatically be added to the website. 
Please follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-website/tree/source) under `Tutorial & Reference Docs`. 

## API Reference 

We use Pydoc-Markdown to create markdown files from the docstrings in our code. 
There is a Github Action that regenerates the API pages with each commit.


If you want to generate a new markdown file for a new haystack module, 
please create a `.yml` file in `docs/src/api/api` which configures how Pydoc-Markdown will generate the page. 
To include it into the docs website, push it to master and follow the steps described 
[here](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-website/tree/source) under `Tutorial & Reference Docs`. 

### Configuration

Pydoc will read the configuration from a `.yml` file which is located under `/haystack/docs/_src/api/pydoc`. Our files contains three main sections:

- **loader**: A list of plugins that load API objects from python source files.
    - **type**: Loader for python source files
    - **search_path**: Location of source files 
    - **modules**: Module which are used for generating the markdown file
    - **ignore_when_discovered**: Define which files should be ignored
- **processor**: A list of plugins that process API objects to modify their docstrings (e.g. to adapt them from a documentation format to Markdown or to remove items that should not be rendered into the documentation).
    - **type: filter**: Filter for specific modules
    - **documented_only**: Only documented API objects
    - **do_not_filter_modules**: Do not filter module objects
    - **skip_empty_modules**: Skip modules without content
- **renderer**: A plugin that produces the output files.
    - **type**: Define the renderer which you want to use. We are using the Markdown renderer as it can be configured in very detail.
    - **descriptive_class_title**: Remove the word "Object" from class titles. 
    - **descriptive_module_title**:  Adding the word “Module” before the module name
    - **add_method_class_prefix**: Add the class name as a prefix to method names
    - **add_member_class_prefix**: Add the class name as a prefix to member names
    - **filename**: file name of the generated file
