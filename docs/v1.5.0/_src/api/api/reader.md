## FARMReader

```python
class FARMReader(BaseReader)
```

Transformer based model for extractive Question Answering using the FARM framework (https://github.com/deepset-ai/FARM).
While the underlying model can vary (BERT, Roberta, DistilBERT, ...), the interface remains the same.

|  With a FARMReader, you can:

 - directly get predictions via predict()
 - fine-tune the model on QA data via train()

<a id="farm.FARMReader.__init__"></a>

#### FARMReader.\_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(model_name_or_path: str, model_version: Optional[str] = None, context_window_size: int = 150, batch_size: int = 50, use_gpu: bool = True, devices: List[torch.device] = [], no_ans_boost: float = 0.0, return_no_answer: bool = False, top_k: int = 10, top_k_per_candidate: int = 3, top_k_per_sample: int = 1, num_processes: Optional[int] = None, max_seq_len: int = 256, doc_stride: int = 128, progress_bar: bool = True, duplicate_filtering: int = 0, use_confidence_scores: bool = True, confidence_threshold: Optional[float] = None, proxies: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None, local_files_only=False, force_download=False, use_auth_token: Optional[Union[str, bool]] = None)
```

**Arguments**:

- `model_name_or_path`: Directory of a saved model or the name of a public model e.g. 'bert-base-cased',
'deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2', 'deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2', 'distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad'.
See https://huggingface.co/models for full list of available models.
- `model_version`: The version of model to use from the HuggingFace model hub. Can be tag name, branch name, or commit hash.
- `context_window_size`: The size, in characters, of the window around the answer span that is used when
displaying the context around the answer.
- `batch_size`: Number of samples the model receives in one batch for inference.
Memory consumption is much lower in inference mode. Recommendation: Increase the batch size
to a value so only a single batch is used.
- `use_gpu`: Whether to use GPUs or the CPU. Falls back on CPU if no GPU is available.
- `devices`: List of GPU devices to limit inference to certain GPUs and not use all available ones (e.g. [torch.device('cuda:0')]).
Unused if `use_gpu` is False.
- `no_ans_boost`: How much the no_answer logit is boosted/increased.
If set to 0 (default), the no_answer logit is not changed.
If a negative number, there is a lower chance of "no_answer" being predicted.
If a positive number, there is an increased chance of "no_answer"
- `return_no_answer`: Whether to include no_answer predictions in the results.
- `top_k`: The maximum number of answers to return
- `top_k_per_candidate`: How many answers to extract for each candidate doc that is coming from the retriever (might be a long text).
Note that this is not the number of "final answers" you will receive
(see `top_k` in FARMReader.predict() or Finder.get_answers() for that)
and that FARM includes no_answer in the sorted list of predictions.
- `top_k_per_sample`: How many answers to extract from each small text passage that the model can process at once
(one "candidate doc" is usually split into many smaller "passages").
You usually want a very small value here, as it slows down inference
and you don't gain much of quality by having multiple answers from one passage.
Note that this is not the number of "final answers" you will receive
(see `top_k` in FARMReader.predict() or Finder.get_answers() for that)
and that FARM includes no_answer in the sorted list of predictions.
- `num_processes`: The number of processes for `multiprocessing.Pool`. Set to value of 0 to disable
multiprocessing. Set to None to let Inferencer determine optimum number. If you
want to debug the Language Model, you might need to disable multiprocessing!
- `max_seq_len`: Max sequence length of one input text for the model
- `doc_stride`: Length of striding window for splitting long texts (used if ``len(text) > max_seq_len``)
- `progress_bar`: Whether to show a tqdm progress bar or not.
Can be helpful to disable in production deployments to keep the logs clean.
- `duplicate_filtering`: Answers are filtered based on their position. Both start and end position of the answers are considered.
The higher the value, answers that are more apart are filtered out. 0 corresponds to exact duplicates. -1 turns off duplicate removal.
- `use_confidence_scores`: Sets the type of score that is returned with every predicted answer.
`True` => a scaled confidence / relevance score between [0, 1].
This score can also be further calibrated on your dataset via self.eval()
(see https://haystack.deepset.ai/components/v1.5.0/reader#confidence-scores) .
`False` => an unscaled, raw score [-inf, +inf] which is the sum of start and end logit
from the model for the predicted span.
- `confidence_threshold`: Filters out predictions below confidence_threshold. Value should be between 0 and 1. Disabled by default.
- `proxies`: Dict of proxy servers to use for downloading external models. Example: {'http': 'some.proxy:1234', 'http://hostname': 'my.proxy:3111'}
- `local_files_only`: Whether to force checking for local files only (and forbid downloads)
- `force_download`: Whether fo force a (re-)download even if the model exists locally in the cache.
- `use_auth_token`: API token used to download private models from Huggingface. If this parameter is set to `True`,
the local token will be used, which must be previously created via `transformer-cli login`.

Fine-tune a model on a QA dataset using logit-based distillation. You need to provide a teacher model that is already finetuned on the dataset

and a student model that will be trained using the teacher's logits. The idea of this is to increase the accuracy of a lightweight student model.
using a more complex teacher.

```python
student = FARMReader(model_name_or_path="prajjwal1/bert-medium")

<a id="farm.FARMReader.convert_to_onnx"></a>

#### FARMReader.convert\_to\_onnx

```python
@classmethod
def convert_to_onnx(cls, model_name: str, output_path: Path, convert_to_float16: bool = False, quantize: bool = False, task_type: str = "question_answering", opset_version: int = 11)
```

Convert a PyTorch BERT model to ONNX format and write to ./onnx-export dir. The converted ONNX model

can be loaded with in the `FARMReader` using the export path as `model_name_or_path` param.

Usage:

    `from haystack.reader.farm import FARMReader
    from pathlib import Path
    onnx_model_path = Path("roberta-onnx-model")
    FARMReader.convert_to_onnx(model_name="deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2", output_path=onnx_model_path)
    reader = FARMReader(onnx_model_path)`

**Arguments**:

- `model_name`: transformers model name
- `output_path`: Path to output the converted model
- `convert_to_float16`: Many models use float32 precision by default. With the half precision of float16,
inference is faster on Nvidia GPUs with Tensor core like T4 or V100. On older GPUs,
float32 could still be be more performant.
- `quantize`: convert floating point number to integers
- `task_type`: Type of task for the model. Available options: "question_answering" or "embeddings".
- `opset_version`: ONNX opset version

## TransformersReader

```python
class TransformersReader(BaseReader)
```

Transformer based model for extractive Question Answering using the HuggingFace's transformers framework
(https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).
While the underlying model can vary (BERT, Roberta, DistilBERT ...), the interface remains the same.
With this reader, you can directly get predictions via predict()

<a id="transformers.TransformersReader.__init__"></a>

#### TransformersReader.\_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(model_name_or_path: str = "distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad", model_version: Optional[str] = None, tokenizer: Optional[str] = None, context_window_size: int = 70, use_gpu: bool = True, top_k: int = 10, top_k_per_candidate: int = 3, return_no_answers: bool = False, max_seq_len: int = 256, doc_stride: int = 128, batch_size: Optional[int] = None)
```

Load a QA model from Transformers.

Available models include:

- ``'distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad`'``
- ``'bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad``'
- ``'bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad``'

See https://huggingface.co/models for full list of available QA models

**Arguments**:

- `model_name_or_path`: Directory of a saved model or the name of a public model e.g. 'bert-base-cased',
'deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2', 'deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2', 'distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad'.
See https://huggingface.co/models for full list of available models.
- `model_version`: The version of model to use from the HuggingFace model hub. Can be tag name, branch name, or commit hash.
- `tokenizer`: Name of the tokenizer (usually the same as model)
- `context_window_size`: Num of chars (before and after the answer) to return as "context" for each answer.
The context usually helps users to understand if the answer really makes sense.
- `use_gpu`: Whether to use GPU (if available).
- `top_k`: The maximum number of answers to return
- `top_k_per_candidate`: How many answers to extract for each candidate doc that is coming from the retriever (might be a long text).
Note that this is not the number of "final answers" you will receive
(see `top_k` in TransformersReader.predict() or Finder.get_answers() for that)
and that no_answer can be included in the sorted list of predictions.
- `return_no_answers`: If True, the HuggingFace Transformers model could return a "no_answer" (i.e. when there is an unanswerable question)
If False, it cannot return a "no_answer". Note that `no_answer_boost` is unfortunately not available with TransformersReader.
If you would like to set no_answer_boost, use a `FARMReader`.
- `max_seq_len`: max sequence length of one input text for the model
- `doc_stride`: length of striding window for splitting long texts (used if len(text) > max_seq_len)
- `batch_size`: Number of documents to process at a time.

- ``'deepset/tapas-large-nq-reader'``

See https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=table-question-answering
for full list of available TableQA models.

The nq-reader models are able to provide confidence scores, but cannot handle questions that need aggregation
over multiple cells. The returned answers are sorted first by a general table score and then by answer span
scores.
All the other models can handle aggregation questions, but don't provide reasonable confidence scores.

**Arguments**:

- `model_name_or_path`: Directory of a saved model or the name of a public model e.g.
See https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=table-question-answering for full list of available models.
- `model_version`: The version of model to use from the HuggingFace model hub. Can be tag name, branch name,
or commit hash.
- `tokenizer`: Name of the tokenizer (usually the same as model)
- `use_gpu`: Whether to use GPU or CPU. Falls back on CPU if no GPU is available.
- `top_k`: The maximum number of answers to return
- `top_k_per_candidate`: How many answers to extract for each candidate table that is coming from
the retriever.
- `return_no_answer`: Whether to include no_answer predictions in the results.
(Only applicable with nq-reader models.)
- `max_seq_len`: Max sequence length of one input table for the model. If the number of tokens of
query + table exceed max_seq_len, the table will be truncated by removing rows until the
input size fits the model.

<a id="table.RCIReader"></a>

## RCIReader

```python
class RCIReader(BaseReader)
```

Table Reader model based on Glass et al. (2021)'s Row-Column-Intersection model.
See the original paper for more details:
Glass, Michael, et al. (2021): "Capturing Row and Column Semantics in Transformer Based Question Answering over Tables"
(https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.96/)

Each row and each column is given a score with regard to the query by two separate models. The score of each cell
is then calculated as the sum of the corresponding row score and column score. Accordingly, the predicted answer is
the cell with the highest score.

Pros and Cons of RCIReader compared to TableReader:
+ Provides meaningful confidence scores
+ Allows larger tables as input
- Does not support aggregation over table cells
- Slower
