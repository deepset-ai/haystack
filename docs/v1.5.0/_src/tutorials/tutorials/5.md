# Evaluation of a Pipeline and its Components

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorial5_Evaluation.ipynb)

To be able to make a statement about the quality of results a question-answering pipeline or any other pipeline in haystack produces, it is important to evaluate it. Furthermore, evaluation allows determining which components of the pipeline can be improved.
The results of the evaluation can be saved as CSV files, which contain all the information to calculate additional metrics later on or inspect individual predictions.

### Prepare environment

#### Colab: Enable the GPU runtime
Make sure you enable the GPU runtime to experience decent speed in this tutorial.
**Runtime -> Change Runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepset-ai/haystack/master/docs/img/colab_gpu_runtime.jpg">


```python
# Make sure you have a GPU running
!nvidia-smi
```


```python
# Install the latest release of Haystack in your own environment
#! pip install farm-haystack

# Install the latest master of Haystack
!pip install --upgrade pip
!pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git#egg=farm-haystack[colab]
```

## Start an Elasticsearch server
You can start Elasticsearch on your local machine instance using Docker. If Docker is not readily available in your environment (eg., in Colab notebooks), then you can manually download and execute Elasticsearch from source.


```python
# If Docker is available: Start Elasticsearch as docker container
# from haystack.utils import launch_es
# launch_es()

# Alternative in Colab / No Docker environments: Start Elasticsearch from source
! wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-7.9.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -q
! tar -xzf elasticsearch-7.9.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
! chown -R daemon:daemon elasticsearch-7.9.2

import os
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT

es_server = Popen(
    ["elasticsearch-7.9.2/bin/elasticsearch"], stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT, preexec_fn=lambda: os.setuid(1)  # as daemon
)
# wait until ES has started
! sleep 30
```

## Fetch, Store And Preprocess the Evaluation Dataset


```python
from haystack.utils import fetch_archive_from_http

# Download evaluation data, which is a subset of Natural Questions development set containing 50 documents with one question per document and multiple annotated answers
doc_dir = "data/tutorial5"
s3_url = "https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/deepset.ai-farm-qa/datasets/nq_dev_subset_v2.json.zip"
fetch_archive_from_http(url=s3_url, output_dir=doc_dir)
```


```python
# make sure these indices do not collide with existing ones, the indices will be wiped clean before data is inserted
doc_index = "tutorial5_docs"
label_index = "tutorial5_labels"
```


```python
# Connect to Elasticsearch
from haystack.document_stores import ElasticsearchDocumentStore

# Connect to Elasticsearch
document_store = ElasticsearchDocumentStore(
    host="localhost",
    username="",
    password="",
    index=doc_index,
    label_index=label_index,
    embedding_field="emb",
    embedding_dim=768,
    excluded_meta_data=["emb"],
)
```


```python
from haystack.nodes import PreProcessor

# Add evaluation data to Elasticsearch Document Store
# We first delete the custom tutorial indices to not have duplicate elements
# and also split our documents into shorter passages using the PreProcessor
preprocessor = PreProcessor(
    split_length=200,
    split_overlap=0,
    split_respect_sentence_boundary=False,
    clean_empty_lines=False,
    clean_whitespace=False,
)
document_store.delete_documents(index=doc_index)
document_store.delete_documents(index=label_index)

# The add_eval_data() method converts the given dataset in json format into Haystack document and label objects. Those objects are then indexed in their respective document and label index in the document store. The method can be used with any dataset in SQuAD format.
document_store.add_eval_data(
    filename="data/tutorial5/nq_dev_subset_v2.json",
    doc_index=doc_index,
    label_index=label_index,
    preprocessor=preprocessor,
)
```

## Initialize the Two Components of an ExtractiveQAPipeline: Retriever and Reader


```python
# Initialize Retriever
from haystack.nodes import BM25Retriever

retriever = BM25Retriever(document_store=document_store)

# Alternative: Evaluate dense retrievers (EmbeddingRetriever or DensePassageRetriever)
# The EmbeddingRetriever uses a single transformer based encoder model for query and document.
# In contrast, DensePassageRetriever uses two separate encoders for both.

# Please make sure the "embedding_dim" parameter in the DocumentStore above matches the output dimension of your models!
# Please also take care that the PreProcessor splits your files into chunks that can be completely converted with
#        the max_seq_len limitations of Transformers
# The SentenceTransformer model "sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1" generally works well with the EmbeddingRetriever on any kind of English text.
# For more information and suggestions on different models check out the documentation at: https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html

# from haystack.retriever import EmbeddingRetriever, DensePassageRetriever
# retriever = EmbeddingRetriever(document_store=document_store, model_format="sentence_transformers",
#                                embedding_model="sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1")
# retriever = DensePassageRetriever(document_store=document_store,
#                                   query_embedding_model="facebook/dpr-question_encoder-single-nq-base",
#                                   passage_embedding_model="facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base",
#                                   use_gpu=True,
#                                   max_seq_len_passage=256,
#                                   embed_title=True)
# document_store.update_embeddings(retriever, index=doc_index)
```


```python
# Initialize Reader
from haystack.nodes import FARMReader

reader = FARMReader("deepset/roberta-base-squad2", top_k=4, return_no_answer=True)

# Define a pipeline consisting of the initialized retriever and reader
from haystack.pipelines import ExtractiveQAPipeline

pipeline = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader=reader, retriever=retriever)

# The evaluation also works with any other pipeline.
# For example you could use a DocumentSearchPipeline as an alternative:

# from haystack.pipelines import DocumentSearchPipeline
# pipeline = DocumentSearchPipeline(retriever=retriever)
```

## Evaluation of an ExtractiveQAPipeline
Here we evaluate retriever and reader in open domain fashion on the full corpus of documents i.e. a document is considered
correctly retrieved if it contains the gold answer string within it. The reader is evaluated based purely on the
predicted answer string, regardless of which document this came from and the position of the extracted span.

The generation of predictions is seperated from the calculation of metrics. This allows you to run the computation-heavy model predictions only once and then iterate flexibly on the metrics or reports you want to generate.



```python
from haystack.schema import EvaluationResult, MultiLabel

# We can load evaluation labels from the document store
# We are also opting to filter out no_answer samples
eval_labels = document_store.get_all_labels_aggregated(drop_negative_labels=True, drop_no_answers=True)

## Alternative: Define queries and labels directly

# eval_labels = [
#    MultiLabel(
#        labels=[
#            Label(
#                query="who is written in the book of life",
#                answer=Answer(
#                    answer="every person who is destined for Heaven or the World to Come",
#                    offsets_in_context=[Span(374, 434)]
#                ),
#                document=Document(
#                    id='1b090aec7dbd1af6739c4c80f8995877-0',
#                    content_type="text",
#                    content='Book of Life - wikipedia Book of Life Jump to: navigation, search This article is
#                       about the book mentioned in Christian and Jewish religious teachings...'
#                ),
#                is_correct_answer=True,
#                is_correct_document=True,
#                origin="gold-label"
#            )
#        ]
#    )
# ]

# Similar to pipeline.run() we can execute pipeline.eval()
eval_result = pipeline.eval(labels=eval_labels, params={"Retriever": {"top_k": 5}})
```


```python
# The EvaluationResult contains a pandas dataframe for each pipeline node.
# That's why there are two dataframes in the EvaluationResult of an ExtractiveQAPipeline.

retriever_result = eval_result["Retriever"]
retriever_result.head()
```


```python
reader_result = eval_result["Reader"]
reader_result.head()
```


```python
# We can filter for all documents retrieved for a given query
query = "who is written in the book of life"
retriever_book_of_life = retriever_result[retriever_result["query"] == query]
```


```python
# We can also filter for all answers predicted for a given query
reader_book_of_life = reader_result[reader_result["query"] == query]
```


```python
# Save the evaluation result so that we can reload it later and calculate evaluation metrics without running the pipeline again.
eval_result.save("../")
```

## Calculating Evaluation Metrics
Load an EvaluationResult to quickly calculate standard evaluation metrics for all predictions,
such as F1-score of each individual prediction of the Reader node or recall of the retriever.
To learn more about the metrics, see [Evaluation Metrics](https://haystack.deepset.ai/guides/v1.5.0/evaluation#metrics-retrieval)


```python
saved_eval_result = EvaluationResult.load("../")
metrics = saved_eval_result.calculate_metrics()
print(f'Retriever - Recall (single relevant document): {metrics["Retriever"]["recall_single_hit"]}')
print(f'Retriever - Recall (multiple relevant documents): {metrics["Retriever"]["recall_multi_hit"]}')
print(f'Retriever - Mean Reciprocal Rank: {metrics["Retriever"]["mrr"]}')
print(f'Retriever - Precision: {metrics["Retriever"]["precision"]}')
print(f'Retriever - Mean Average Precision: {metrics["Retriever"]["map"]}')

print(f'Reader - F1-Score: {metrics["Reader"]["f1"]}')
print(f'Reader - Exact Match: {metrics["Reader"]["exact_match"]}')
```

## Generating an Evaluation Report
A summary of the evaluation results can be printed to get a quick overview. It includes some aggregated metrics and also shows a few wrongly predicted examples.


```python
pipeline.print_eval_report(saved_eval_result)
```

## Advanced Evaluation Metrics
As an advanced evaluation metric, semantic answer similarity (SAS) can be calculated. This metric takes into account whether the meaning of a predicted answer is similar to the annotated gold answer rather than just doing string comparison.
To this end SAS relies on pre-trained models. For English, we recommend "cross-encoder/stsb-roberta-large", whereas for German we recommend "deepset/gbert-large-sts". A good multilingual model is "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2".
More info on this metric can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06130) or in our [blog post](https://www.deepset.ai/blog/semantic-answer-similarity-to-evaluate-qa).


```python
advanced_eval_result = pipeline.eval(
    labels=eval_labels, params={"Retriever": {"top_k": 5}}, sas_model_name_or_path="cross-encoder/stsb-roberta-large"
)

metrics = advanced_eval_result.calculate_metrics()
print(metrics["Reader"]["sas"])
```

## Isolated Evaluation Mode
The isolated node evaluation uses labels as input to the Reader node instead of the output of the preceeding Retriever node.
Thereby, we can additionally calculate the upper bounds of the evaluation metrics of the Reader. Note that even with isolated evaluation enabled, integrated evaluation will still be running.



```python
eval_result_with_upper_bounds = pipeline.eval(
    labels=eval_labels, params={"Retriever": {"top_k": 5}, "Reader": {"top_k": 5}}, add_isolated_node_eval=True
)
```


```python
pipeline.print_eval_report(eval_result_with_upper_bounds)
```

## Evaluation of Individual Components: Retriever
Sometimes you might want to evaluate individual components, for example, if you don't have a pipeline but only a retriever or a reader with a model that you trained yourself.
Here we evaluate only the retriever, based on whether the gold_label document is retrieved.


```python
## Evaluate Retriever on its own
# Note that no_answer samples are omitted when evaluation is performed with this method
retriever_eval_results = retriever.eval(top_k=5, label_index=label_index, doc_index=doc_index)
# Retriever Recall is the proportion of questions for which the correct document containing the answer is
# among the correct documents
print("Retriever Recall:", retriever_eval_results["recall"])
# Retriever Mean Avg Precision rewards retrievers that give relevant documents a higher rank
print("Retriever Mean Avg Precision:", retriever_eval_results["map"])
```

Just as a sanity check, we can compare the recall from `retriever.eval()` with the multi hit recall from `pipeline.eval(add_isolated_node_eval=True)`.
These two recall metrics are only comparable since we chose to filter out no_answer samples when generating eval_labels and setting doc_relevance_col to `"gold_id_match"`. Per default `calculate_metrics()` has doc_relevance_col set to `"gold_id_or_answer_match"` which interprets documents as relevant if they either match the gold_id or contain the answer.


```python
metrics = eval_result_with_upper_bounds.calculate_metrics(doc_relevance_col="gold_id_match")
print(metrics["Retriever"]["recall_multi_hit"])
```

## Evaluation of Individual Components: Reader
Here we evaluate only the reader in a closed domain fashion i.e. the reader is given one query
and its corresponding relevant document and metrics are calculated on whether the right position in this text is selected by
the model as the answer span (i.e. SQuAD style)


```python
# Evaluate Reader on its own
reader_eval_results = reader.eval(document_store=document_store, label_index=label_index, doc_index=doc_index)
top_n = reader_eval_results["top_n"]
# Evaluation of Reader can also be done directly on a SQuAD-formatted file without passing the data to Elasticsearch
# reader_eval_results = reader.eval_on_file("../data/nq", "nq_dev_subset_v2.json", device=device)

# Reader Top-N-Accuracy is the proportion of predicted answers that match with their corresponding correct answer including no_answers
print(f"Reader Top-{top_n}-Accuracy:", reader_eval_results["top_n_accuracy"])
# Reader Top-1-Exact Match is the proportion of questions where the first predicted answer is exactly the same as the correct answer including no_answers
print("Reader Top-1-Exact Match:", reader_eval_results["EM"])
# Reader Top-1-F1-Score is the average overlap between the first predicted answers and the correct answers including no_answers
print("Reader Top-1-F1-Score:", reader_eval_results["f1"])
# Reader Top-N-Accuracy is the proportion of predicted answers that match with their corresponding correct answer excluding no_answers
print(f"Reader Top-{top_n}-Accuracy (without no_answers):", reader_eval_results["top_n_accuracy_text_answer"])
# Reader Top-N-Exact Match is the proportion of questions where the predicted answer within the first n results is exactly the same as the correct answer excluding no_answers (no_answers are always present within top n).
print(f"Reader Top-{top_n}-Exact Match (without no_answers):", reader_eval_results["top_n_EM_text_answer"])
# Reader Top-N-F1-Score is the average overlap between the top n predicted answers and the correct answers excluding no_answers (no_answers are always present within top n).
print(f"Reader Top-{top_n}-F1-Score (without no_answers):", reader_eval_results["top_n_f1_text_answer"])
```

Just as a sanity check, we can compare the top-n exact_match and f1 metrics from `reader.eval()` with the exact_match and f1 from `pipeline.eval(add_isolated_node_eval=True)`.
These two approaches return the same values because pipeline.eval() calculates top-n metrics per default. Small discrepancies might occur due to string normalization in pipeline.eval()'s answer-to-label comparison. reader.eval() does not use string normalization.


```python
metrics = eval_result_with_upper_bounds.calculate_metrics(eval_mode="isolated")
print(metrics["Reader"]["exact_match"])
print(metrics["Reader"]["f1"])
```
