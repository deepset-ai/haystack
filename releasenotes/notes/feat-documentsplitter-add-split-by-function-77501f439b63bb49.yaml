    Added the option to use a custom splitting function in DocumentSplitter. The function must accept a string as
    input and return a list of strings, representing the split units. To use the feature initialise `DocumentSplitter`
    with `split_by="function"` providing the custom splitting function as `splitting_function=custom_function`.
