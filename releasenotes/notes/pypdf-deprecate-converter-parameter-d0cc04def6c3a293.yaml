deprecations:
  - |
    The `converter` parameter in the `PyPDFToDocument` component is deprecated and will be removed in Haystack 2.9.0.
    For in-depth customization of the conversion process, consider implementing a custom component.
    Additional high-level customization options will be added in the future.
