    Add SerpexWebSearch component to the fetchers module. This new component enables fetching organic web search results
    from multiple search engines (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Brave, Yahoo, Yandex) via the SERPEX API. The component
    supports configurable search engines, result counts, time range filtering, and automatic retry logic. Search results
    are returned as Haystack Document objects with rich metadata including titles, URLs, positions, and snippets.
