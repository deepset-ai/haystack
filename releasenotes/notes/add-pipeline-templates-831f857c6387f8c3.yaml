   Introducing a flexible and dynamic approach to creating NLP pipelines with predefined templates.
   This innovative feature allows users to easily construct and customize complex data processing pipelines for various
   NLP tasks.

   For example, the following pipeline template can be used to create an indexing pipeline:
   ```python
   from haystack import Pipeline, PredefinedPipeline

   pipe = Pipeline.from_template(PredefinedPipeline.INDEXING)
   result = pipe.run({"converter": {"sources": ["some_file.txt"]}})
   ```
