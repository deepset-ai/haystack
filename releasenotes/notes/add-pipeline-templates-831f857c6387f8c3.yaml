   Introducing a flexible and dynamic approach to creating NLP pipelines with Haystack's new PipelineTemplate class!
   This innovative feature utilizes Jinja2 templated YAML files, allowing users to effortlessly construct and customize
   complex data processing pipelines for various NLP tasks. From question answering and document indexing to custom
   pipeline requirements, the PipelineTemplate simplifies configuration and enhances adaptability. Users can now easily
   override default components or integrate custom settings with simple, straightforward code.

   For example, the following pipeline template can be used to create an indexing pipeline:
   ```python
   from haystack.components.embedders import SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder
   from haystack.templates import PipelineTemplate

   pt = PipelineTemplate("indexing", template_params={"use_pdf_file_converter": True})
   pt.override("embedder", SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder(progress_bar=True))
   pipe = ptb.build()

   result = pipe.run(data={"sources": ["some_local_dir/and_text_file.txt", "some_other_local_dir/and_pdf_file.pdf"]})
   print(result)
   ```

   In the above example, the pipeline template "indexing" is used to create a pipeline with a custom instance of
   SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder and the PDF file converter enabled. The pipeline is then run on a list of
   local files and the result is printed (number of indexed documents).

   We could have of course used the same PipelineTemplate class to create any other pre-defined pipeline or even a
   custom pipeline with custom components and settings.

   On the other hand, the following pipeline template can be used to create a pre-defined RAG pipeline:
   ```python
   from haystack.templates import PipelineTemplate

   pipe = PipelineTemplate("rag").build()
   result = pipe.run(query="What's the meaning of life?")
   print(result)
   ```
