    Add a new ContextRelevanceEvaluator component that can be used to evaluate whether retrieved documents are relevant to answer a question with a RAG pipeline.
    Given a question and a list of retrieved document contents (contexts), an LLM is used to score to what extent the provided context is relevant. The score ranges from 0 to 1.
