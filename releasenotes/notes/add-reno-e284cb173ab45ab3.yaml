    Release notes are now managed by `reno`. The main difference is that
    every contributor is responsible for adding release notes for the feature or bugfix they're
    introducing in Haystack in the very same Pull Request containing the code changes. The
    goal is to encourage detailed and accurate notes for every release, especially when it comes
    to complex features or breaking changes.

    If you're a Haystack contributor, you need a new tool called `reno` to manage the release notes.
    Please run `pip install -e .[dev]` to ensure you have `reno` available in your environment.
