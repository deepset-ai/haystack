upgrade:
  - |
    If you have a `LocalWhisperTranscriber` in a pipeline, change the `audio_files`
    input name to `sources`. Similarly for standalone invocation of the component,
    pass `sources` instead of `audio_files` to the `run()` method.
enhancements:
  - |
    Add support for `ByteStream` to `LocalWhisperTranscriber` and uniform the
    input socket names to the other components in Haystack.
