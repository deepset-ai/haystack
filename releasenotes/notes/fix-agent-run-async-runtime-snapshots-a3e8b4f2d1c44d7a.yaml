fixes:
  - |
    Fixed ``Agent.run_async`` to mirror ``Agent.run`` crash handling for internal ``chat_generator`` and
    ``tool_invoker`` failures.
    Async runs now wrap internal ``PipelineRuntimeError`` exceptions with Agent context and attach pipeline snapshots
    so standalone async failures can be debugged and resumed consistently.
  - |
    Fixed ToolBreakpoint validation in ``Agent.run`` and ``Agent.run_async`` to validate against tools selected for
    the current run. This allows breakpoints for runtime tool overrides to work correctly.
