    Fixed a bug in flexible Pipeline connections that prevented automatic value conversion when the receiving
    component expects a Union type.
    For example, connecting a component returning ``ChatMessage`` to a receiver expecting
    ``list[str] | list[ChatMessage]`` should have worked but did not.
    The conversion strategy now correctly evaluates each branch of a Union receiver and picks the best match.
