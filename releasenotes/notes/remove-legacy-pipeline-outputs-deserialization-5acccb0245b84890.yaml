    Remove backward-compatibility support for deserializing pipeline snapshots with
    the old ``pipeline_outputs`` format. Pipeline snapshots created before Haystack 2.22.0
    that contain ``pipeline_outputs`` without the ``serialization_schema`` and ``serialized_data``
    structure are no longer supported. Users should recreate their pipeline snapshots
    with the current Haystack version before upgrading to 2.23.0.
