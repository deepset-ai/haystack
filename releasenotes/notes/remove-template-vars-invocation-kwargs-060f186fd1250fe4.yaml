    This update impacts only those who have created custom invocation layers by subclassing PromptModelInvocationLayer.
    Previously, the invoke() method in your custom layer received all prompt template parameters (like query,
    documents, etc.) as keyword arguments. With this change, these parameters will no longer be passed in as keyword
    arguments. If you've implemented such a custom layer, you'll need to potentially update your code to accommodate
    this change.
enhancements:
  - |
    Remove template variables from invocation layer kwargs
