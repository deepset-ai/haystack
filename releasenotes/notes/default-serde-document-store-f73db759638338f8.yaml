    component_from_dict/component_to_dict now work out of the box with custom components that have an object as init parameter as long as the object defines to_dict/from_dict methods.
    Users no longer need to explicitly define to_dict/from_dict methods in their custom components in such cases.
    For example, a custom retriever, which has a DocumentStore as an init parameter, does not need explicitly defined to_dict/from_dict methods.
    component_from_dict/component_to_dict now handle such cases automatically.
