    Haystack now supports Amazon Bedrock models, including all existing and previously announced
    models, like Llama-2-70b-chat. To use these models, simply pass the model ID in the
    model_name_or_path parameter, like you do for any other model. For details, see
    [Amazon Bedrock Docmentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids-arns.html).

    For example, the following code loads the Llama 2 Chat 13B model:
    ```python
    from haystack.nodes import PromptNode

    prompt_node = PromptNode(model_name_or_path="meta.llama2-13b-chat-v1")
    ```
