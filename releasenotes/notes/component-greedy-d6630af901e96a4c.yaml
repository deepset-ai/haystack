    Add `is_greedy` argument to `@component` decorator.
    This flag will change the behaviour of `Component`s with inputs that have a `Variadic` type
    when running inside a `Pipeline`.

    Variadic `Component`s that are marked as greedy will run as soon as they receive their first input.
    If not marked as greedy instead they'll wait as long as possible before running to make sure they
    receive as many inputs as possible from their senders.

    It will be ignored for all other `Component`s even if set explicitly.
