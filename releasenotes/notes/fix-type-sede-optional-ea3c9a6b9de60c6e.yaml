enhancements:
  - |
    - Simplified the serialization code for better readability and maintainability.
    - Updated deserialization to allow users to omit the `typing.` prefix for standard typing library types (e.g., `List[str]` instead of `typing.List[str]`).
fixes:
  - |
    Improved serialization and deserialization in `haystack/utils/type_serialization.py` to handle `Optional` types correctly.
