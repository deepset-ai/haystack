    In Haystack 2.9.0, the `ChatMessage` dataclass will be refactored to make it more flexible and future-proof.
    As part of this change, the `content` attribute will be removed.
    A new `text` property has been introduced to provide access to the textual value of the `ChatMessage`.
    To ensure a smooth transition, start using the `text` property now in place of `content`.
