    Introduce the DocumentLengthRouter, a component for routing Documents based on the length of the `content` field.

    A common use case for DocumentLengthRouter is handling documents obtained from PDFs that contain non-text
    content, such as scanned pages or images. This component can detect empty or low-content documents and route them to
    components that perform OCR, generate captions, or compute image embeddings.
