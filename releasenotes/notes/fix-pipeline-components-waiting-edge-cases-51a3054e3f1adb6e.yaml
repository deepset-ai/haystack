    Added a fix to the pipeline's component scheduling algorithm to reduce edge cases where the execution order of
    components that are simultaneously waiting for inputs has an impact on a pipeline's output. We look at topolgical
    order first to see which of the waiting components should run first and fall back to lexicographical order when both
    components are on the same topology-level. In cyclic pipelines, if the waiting components are in the same cycle,
    we fall back to lexicographical order immediately.
