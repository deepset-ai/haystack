    Fixed pydoc examples in audio and builder components to be valid executable scripts.
    Added missing ``Secret`` import in ``RemoteWhisperTranscriber`` example, fixed unterminated
    string literals in ``ChatPromptBuilder`` examples, and updated file paths to use actual test
    files instead of placeholders. API key examples now use environment variables instead of
    hardcoded placeholders. This ensures all documentation examples can be tested and executed
    successfully.
