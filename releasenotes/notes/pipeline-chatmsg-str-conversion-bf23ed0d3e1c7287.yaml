    Pipelines now support connection and automatic conversion between ``ChatMessage`` and ``str`` types.
    - When a ``str`` output is connected to a ``ChatMessage`` input, it is automatically converted to a user
    ``ChatMessage``.
    - When a ``ChatMessage`` output is connected to a ``str`` input, its ``text`` attribute is automatically
      extracted. If ``text`` is ``None``, an informative ``PipelineRuntimeError`` is raised.
    - To maintain backward compatibility, when multiple connections are available, strict type matching is prioritized
      over conversion.
