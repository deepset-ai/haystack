    Improved ``ComponentTool`` to correctly handle components whose ``run`` method parameters are declared as top-level ``Optional`` types such as ``list[ChatMessage] | None``.
    The optional wrapper is now unwrapped before checking for a ``from_dict`` method on the underlying type.
    As a result, when a parameter is typed as ``list[ChatMessage] | None`` and receives a list of dictionaries, ``ComponentTool`` will automatically coerce the input into a list of ``ChatMessage`` objects using ``ChatMessage.from_dict``.
    If the provided value is ``None``, the parameter is preserved as ``None``.
