    Added new `FastembedColBERTRanker` component to enable bi-encoder reranking using ColBERT models.
    This ranker uses the FastEmbed library to generate token-level embeddings and compute relevance scores
    via the MaxSim algorithm, offering faster inference than cross-encoders while maintaining high accuracy
    for reranking tasks. Addresses issue #8245.
