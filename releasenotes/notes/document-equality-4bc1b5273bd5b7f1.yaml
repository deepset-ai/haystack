    Refactor `Document.__eq__()` so it compares the `Document`s dictionary
    representation instead of only their `id`.
    Previously this comparison would have unexpectedly worked:
    ```python
    first_doc = Document(id="1", content="Hey!")
    second_doc = Document(id="1", content="Hello!")
    assert first_doc == second_doc
    first_doc.content = "Howdy!"
    assert first_doc == second_doc
    ```
    With this change the last comparison would rightly fail.
