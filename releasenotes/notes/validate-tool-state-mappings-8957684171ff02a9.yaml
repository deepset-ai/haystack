    Added validation to ensure that tools' state mappings (``inputs_from_state`` and ``outputs_to_state``)
    reference valid keys in the Agent's state schema. The Agent now raises a ``ValueError`` with helpful
    error messages when tools reference non-existent state keys, catching configuration errors early
    during initialization or runtime tool selection. Handlers in ``outputs_to_state`` can still create
    new state entries dynamically.
