    Introducing ToolSearchToolset - a new toolset that enables agents to dynamically
    discover tools from large catalogs using semantic search. Instead of exposing all
    tools upfront (which can overwhelm LLMs with large tool definitions), agents start
    with a single ``search_tools`` function and progressively discover relevant tools
    as needed. For smaller catalogs, it operates in passthrough mode exposing all tools
    directly.

    Added ``ToolSearchToolset`` to ``haystack.tools`` module. This toolset wraps a catalog
    of tools and provides on-demand tool discovery via BM25 search. Key features include:
    configurable search threshold for automatic passthrough mode, top-k result limiting,
    and a ``clear()`` method to reset discovered tools between agent runs.
