    Introducing SearchableToolset - a new toolset that enables agents to dynamically
    discover tools from large catalogs using keyword-based (BM25) search. Instead of exposing all
    tools upfront (which can overwhelm LLMs with large tool definitions), agents start
    with a single ``search_tools`` function and progressively discover relevant tools
    as needed. For smaller catalogs, it operates in passthrough mode exposing all tools
    directly.

    Added ``SearchableToolset`` to ``haystack.tools`` module. This toolset wraps a catalog
    of tools and provides on-demand tool discovery via BM25 search. Key features include:
    configurable search threshold for automatic passthrough mode, top-k result limiting,
    and a ``clear()`` method to reset discovered tools between agent runs.
