    ComponentTool now preserves and combines docstrings from underlying pipeline components when wrapping a SuperComponent.
    When a SuperComponent is used with ComponentTool, two key improvements are made:

    1. Parameter descriptions are now extracted from the original components in the wrapped pipeline. When
       a single input is mapped to multiple components, the parameter descriptions are combined from all
       mapped components, providing comprehensive information about how the parameter is used throughout the pipeline.

    2. The overall component description is now generated from the descriptions of all underlying components
       instead of using the generic SuperComponent description. This helps LLMs understand what the component
       actually does rather than just seeing "Runs the wrapped pipeline with the provided inputs."

    These changes make SuperComponents much more useful with LLM function calling as the LLM will get detailed
    information about both the component's purpose and its parameters.
