    ComponentTool now preserves docstrings from underlying pipeline components when wrapping a SuperComponent.
    When a SuperComponent is used with ComponentTool, the parameter descriptions are now extracted from the
    original components in the wrapped pipeline, making it much more helpful when using SuperComponents with
    LLM function calling as the LLM will get detailed parameter information directly from the underlying components.
