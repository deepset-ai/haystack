enhancements:
  - |
    `PromptBuilder` now supports changing its template at runtime (e.g. for Prompt Engineering). This allows you to define a default template and then change it based on your needs at runtime.
deprecations:
  - |
    `DynamicPromptBuilder` has been deprecated as `PromptBuilder` fully covers its functionality. Use `PromptBuilder` instead.
