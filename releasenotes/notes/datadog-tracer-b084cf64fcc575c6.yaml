    Added out-of-the-box support for the Datadog Tracer. This allows you to instrument pipeline and component
    runs using Datadog and send traces to your preferred backend.

    To use the Datadog Tracer you need to have the `ddtrace` package installed in your environment.
    To instruct Haystack to use the Datadog tracer, you have multiple options:

    * Run your Haystack application using the `ddtrace` command line tool as described in the
      the [ddtrace documentation](https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation_quickstart.html#tracing).
      This behavior can be disabled by setting the `HAYSTACK_AUTO_TRACE_ENABLED_ENV_VAR` environment variable to `false`.
    * Configure the tracer manually in your code using the `ddtrace` package:
      ```python
      from haystack.tracing import DatadogTracer
      import haystack.tracing
      import ddtrace

      tracer = ddtrace.tracer
      tracing.enable_tracing(DatadogTracer(tracer))
      ```
