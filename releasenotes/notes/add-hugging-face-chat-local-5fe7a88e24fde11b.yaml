    Introducing the HuggingFaceLocalChatGenerator, a new chat-based generator designed for leveraging chat models from
    Hugging Face's (HF) model hub. Users can now perform inference with chat-based models in a local runtime, utilizing
    familiar HF generation parameters, stop words, and even employing custom chat templates for custom message formatting.
    This component also supports streaming responses and is optimized for compatibility with a variety of devices.

    Here is an example of how to use the HuggingFaceLocalChatGenerator:

    ```python
    from haystack.components.generators.chat import HuggingFaceLocalChatGenerator
    from haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage

    generator = HuggingFaceLocalChatGenerator(model="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta")
    generator.warm_up()
    messages = [ChatMessage.from_user("What's Natural Language Processing? Be brief.")]
    print(generator.run(messages))
    ```
