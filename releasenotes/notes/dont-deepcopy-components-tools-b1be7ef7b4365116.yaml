    Updated pipeline execution logic to use a new utility method `deepcopy_with_fallback`,
    which skips deep-copying of `Component`, `Tool`, and `Toolset` instances when used as
    runtime parameters. This prevents errors and unintended behavior caused by trying to
    deepcopy objects that contain non-copyable attributes (e.g. Jinja2 templates, clients).
