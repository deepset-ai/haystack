    Add new `Pipeline.show()` method to generated image inline if run in a Jupyter notebook.
    If called outside a notebook it will raise a `PipelineDrawingError`.
    `Pipeline.draw()` has also been simplified and the `engine` argument has been removed.
    Now all images will be generated using Mermaid.
