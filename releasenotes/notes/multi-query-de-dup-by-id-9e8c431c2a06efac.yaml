enhancements:

    The ``MultiQueryEmbeddingRetriever`` and ``MultiQueryTextRetriever`` now deduplicate documents by ``id`` instead of by ``content``,
    preventing identical documents from being returned multiple times.

upgrade:
  - |
    Deduplication behavior in ``MultiQueryEmbeddingRetriever`` and ``MultiQueryTextRetriever`` has changed and may be breaking
    for users who relied on deduplication based on document content rather than document id.

    Documents are now considered duplicates only if they share the same ``id``. Document ids can be user-defined or are
    automatically generated as a hash of the document’s attributes (e.g. content, metadata, etc.).

    This change affects setups where multiple documents have identical content but different ids (for example, due to
    differing metadata). To preserve the previous behavior, ensure that documents with identical content are assigned
    the same ``id`` across retriever outputs.
