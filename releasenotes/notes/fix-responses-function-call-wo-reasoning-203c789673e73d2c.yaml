    Fixed a bug in ``OpenAIResponsesChatGenerator`` where empty reasoning items were discarded during streaming.
    This caused subsequent requests to the OpenAI Responses API to fail when the message history was sent back, as the
    API requires every tool call to be preceded by its associated reasoning item.
    These items are now correctly preserved in the ``ChatMessage`` history, even when the summary text is empty.
