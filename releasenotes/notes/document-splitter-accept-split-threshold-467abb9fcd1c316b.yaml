    DocumentSplitter now has an optional split_threshold parameter. Use this parameter if you want to rather not split inputs that are only slightly longer than the allowed split_length. 
    If when chunking one of the chunks is smaller than the split_threshold, the chunk will be concatenated with the previous one. This avoids having too small chunks that are not meaningful.
