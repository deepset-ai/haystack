    The `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` now checks the type of the `arguments` variable in the tool calls returned by the
    Hugging Face API. If `arguments` is a JSON string, it is parsed into a dictionary.
    Previously, the `arguments` type was not checked, which sometimes led to failures later in the tool workflow.
