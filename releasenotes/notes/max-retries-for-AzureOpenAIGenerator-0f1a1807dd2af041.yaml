    Add max_retries to AzureOpenAIGenerator.
    AzureOpenAIGenerator can now be initialised by setting max_retries.
    If not set, it is inferred from the `OPENAI_MAX_RETRIES`
    environment variable or set to 5.
    The timeout for AzureOpenAIGenerator, if not set, it is inferred
    from the `OPENAI_TIMEOUT` environment variable or set to 30.
