enhancements:
  - |
    Made JSON schema validator compatible with all LLM by switching error template handling to a single user message.
    Also reduce cost by only including last error instead of full message history.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix recursive JSON type conversion in the schema validator to be less aggressive (no infinite recursion).
