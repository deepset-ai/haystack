    Improved error messages in ChatMessage deserialization to provide clearer guidance for LLM-agent use cases.
    The `_deserialize_content` function now provides detailed error messages when ChatMessage content format
    is invalid, including the expected structure (list of dictionaries with 'text', 'tool_call', or
    'tool_call_result' keys) and concrete examples. This enhancement reduces debugging cycles and improves
    LLM self-correction capabilities when working with agent tools and structured message formats.
