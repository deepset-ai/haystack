    Refactor `Answer` dataclass and classes that inherited it.
    Now `Answer` is a Protocol, classes that used to inherit it now respect that interface.
    We also added a new `ExtractiveTableAnswer` to be used for table question answering.

    All classes now are easily serializable using `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` like `Document` and components.
