    The `DocumentRecallEvaluator` was updated. Now, when in `MULTI_HIT` mode, the division is over the unique ground truth documents instead of the total number of ground truth documents.
    We also added checks for emptiness. If there are no retrieved documents or all of them have an empty string as content, we return 0.0 and log a warning. Likewise, if there are no ground truth documents or all of them have an empty string as content, we return 0.0 and log a warning.
