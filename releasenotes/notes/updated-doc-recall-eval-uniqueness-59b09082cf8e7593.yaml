    The `DocumentRecallEvaluator` was updated. Now, when in `MULTI_HIT` mode, the division is over the unique ground truth documents instead of the total number of ground truth documents.
    We also added checks for emptiness. If any retrieved or ground truth document is empty or is a document with an empty string, we return 0.0 and log a warning.
