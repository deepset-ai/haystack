    component_from_dict() and component_to_dict() now work with custom components out of the box also if the component has a ComponentDevice as an attribute.
    Users no longer need to explicitly define to_dict() and from_dict() methods in their custom components to call ComponentDevice.from_dict() or device.to_dict().
    component_from_dict() and component_to_dict() now handle this automatically.
