    Introduce a Logging Tracer, that sends all traces to the logs.

    It can enabled as follows:
    ```python
    import logging
    from haystack import tracing
    from haystack.tracing.logging_tracer import LoggingTracer

    logging.basicConfig(format="%(levelname)s - %(name)s -  %(message)s", level=logging.WARNING)
    logging.getLogger("haystack").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    tracing.tracer.is_content_tracing_enabled = True # to enable tracing/logging content (inputs/outputs)
    tracing.enable_tracing(LoggingTracer())
    ```
