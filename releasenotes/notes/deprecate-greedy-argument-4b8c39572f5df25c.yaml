enhancements:
  - |
    Add new `GreedyVariadic` input type. This has a similar behaviour to `Variadic` input type
    as it can be connected to multiple output sockets, though the Pipeline will run it as soon
    as it receives an input without waiting for others.
    This replaces the `is_greedy` argument in the `@component` decorator.
    If you had a Component with a `Variadic` input type and `@component(is_greedy=True)` you need
    to change the type to `GreedyVariadic` and remove `is_greedy=true` from `@component`.
deprecations:
  - |
    `@component` decorator `is_greedy` argument is deprecated and will be removed in version `2.7.0`.
    Use `GreedyVariadic` type instead.
