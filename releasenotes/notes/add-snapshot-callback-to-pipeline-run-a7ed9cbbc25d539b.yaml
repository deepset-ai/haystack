    Added a `snapshot_callback` parameter to `Pipeline.run()` that allows users to customize how pipeline snapshots are handled.
    When a callback is provided, it is invoked instead of the default file-saving behavior whenever a snapshot is created (e.g., during breakpoints or error handling).
    This enables use cases like saving snapshots to a database, sending them to a remote service, or implementing custom logging.
    If no callback is provided, the default behavior of saving to a JSON file remains unchanged.
