    Allow code instrumentation to also trace the input and output of components.
    This is useful for debugging and understanding the behavior of components.
    This behavior is disabled by default and can be enabled with one of the following methods:
    - Set the environment variable `HAYSTACK_CONTENT_TRACING_ENABLED_ENV_VAR` to `true` before importing Haystack.
    - Enable content tracing in the code:
        ```python
        from haystack import tracing
        tracing.tracer.is_content_tracing_enabled = True
        ```
