    Fixed missing trace parentage for tools executed via the synchronous ToolInvoker path.
    Updated `ToolInvoker.run()` to propagate `contextvars` into ThreadPoolExecutor workers,
    ensuring all tool spans (ComponentTool, Agent wrapped in ComponentTool, or custom tools)
    are correctly linked to the outer Agent's trace instead of starting new root traces.
    This improves end-to-end observability across the entire tool execution chain.
