    Make internal tool conversion in the HuggingFaceAPICompatibleChatGenerator compatible with huggingface_hub>=0.31.0.
    In the huggingface_hub library, `arguments` attribute of `ChatCompletionInputFunctionDefinition` has been renamed to
    `parameters`.
    Our implementation is compatible with both the legacy version and the new one.
