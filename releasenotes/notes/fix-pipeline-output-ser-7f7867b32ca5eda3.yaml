    Fix the serialization and deserialization of ``pipeline_outputs`` in ``pipeline_snapshot`` and make it use the same schema as the rest of the pipeline state when running pipelines with breakpoints.
    The deserialization of the older format of ``pipeline_outputs`` without serialization schema is supported till Haystack 2.23.0.
