    Replaced in-place dataclass mutations with `dataclasses.replace()` across multiple components
    (rankers, joiners, fetchers, converters, readers, document stores, and pipeline) to avoid
    unintended side effects and eliminate deprecation warnings introduced by the dataclass mutation
    detection in PR #10650.
