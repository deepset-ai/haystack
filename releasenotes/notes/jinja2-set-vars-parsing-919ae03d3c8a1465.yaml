    Fixed an issue where Jinja2 variable assignments using the `set` directive
    were not being parsed correctly in certain contexts. This fix ensures that
    variables assigned with `{% set var = value %}` are now properly recognized
    and can be used as expected within templates inside `PromptBuilder` and
    `ChatPromptBuilder`.
