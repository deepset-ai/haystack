    `HuggingFaceAPIGenerator` might no longer work with the Hugging Face Inference API.

    As of July 2025, the Hugging Face Inference API no longer offers generative models that support the
    `text_generation` endpoint. Generative models are now only available through providers that support the
    `chat_completion` endpoint.
    As a result, the `HuggingFaceAPIGenerator` component might not work with the Hugging Face Inference API.
    It still works with Hugging Face Inference Endpoints and self-hosted TGI instances.

    To use generative models via Hugging Face Inference API, please use the `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` component,
    which supports the `chat_completion` endpoint.
