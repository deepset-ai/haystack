    Optimize particular methods from PineconeDocumentStore (delete_documents and _get_vector_count)
upgrade:
   - |
    This update enables all Pinecone index types to be used, including Starter.
    Previously, Pinecone Starter index type couldn't be used as document store. Due to limitations of this index type
    (https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/starter-environment), in current implementation fetching documents is limited to
    Pinecone query vector limit (10000 vectors). Accordingly, if the number of documents in the index is above this limit,
    some of PineconeDocumentStore functions will be limited.
