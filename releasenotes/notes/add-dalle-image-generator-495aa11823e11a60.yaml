    We've added a new **DALLEImageGenerator** component, bringing image generation with OpenAI's DALL-E to the Haystack

    - **Easy to Use**: Just a few lines of code to get started:
        ```python
        from haystack.components.generators import DALLEImageGenerator
        image_generator = DALLEImageGenerator()
        response = image_generator.run("Show me a picture of a black cat.")
        print(response)
        ```
