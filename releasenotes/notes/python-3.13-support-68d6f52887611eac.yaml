    Haystack now officially supports Python 3.13.
    Some components and integrations may not yet be compatible.
    Specifically, the `NamedEntityExtractor` does not work with Python 3.13 when using the `spacy` backend.
    Additionally, you may encounter issues installing `openai-whisper`, which is required by the
    `LocalWhisperTranscriber` component, if you use `uv` or `poetry` for installation.
    In this case, we recommend using `pip` for installation.
