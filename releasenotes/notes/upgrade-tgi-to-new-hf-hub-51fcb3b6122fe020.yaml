    The `HuggingFaceTGIGenerator` and `HuggingFaceTGIChatGenerator` components have been modified to be compatible with
    `huggingface_hub>=0.22.0`.

    If you use these components, you may need to upgrade the `huggingface_hub` library.
    To do this, run the following command in your environment:
    ```bash
    pip install "huggingface_hub>=0.22.0"
    ```
