    Removed the deprecated ``PipelineTemplate`` and ``PredefinedPipeline`` classes,
    along with the `Pipeline.from_template()` method.
    Users should migrate to Pipeline YAML files for similar functionality.
    See the [Serialization documentation](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/serialization)
    for details on using YAML-based pipeline definitions.
