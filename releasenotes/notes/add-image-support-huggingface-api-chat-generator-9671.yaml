    Added multimodal support to `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` to enable vision-language model (VLM) usage with images and text.
    Users can now send both text and images to VLM models through Hugging Face APIs. The implementation follows the HF VLM API format
    specification and maintains full backward compatibility with text-only messages.
