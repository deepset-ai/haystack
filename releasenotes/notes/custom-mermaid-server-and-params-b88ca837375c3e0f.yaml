    Drawing pipelines, i.e.: calls to draw() or show(), can now be done using a custom Mermaid server and additional parameters. This allows for more flexibility in how pipelines are rendered. See Mermaid.ink's [documentation](https://github.com/jihchi/mermaid.ink) for more information on how to set up a custom server.
