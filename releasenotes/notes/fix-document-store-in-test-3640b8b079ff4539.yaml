    The `test_comparison_in` test case in the base document store tests used to
    always pass, no matter how the `in` filtering logic was implemented in
    document stores. With the fix, the `in` logic is actually tested. Some tests
    might start to fail for document stores that don't implement the `in` filter
    correctly.
