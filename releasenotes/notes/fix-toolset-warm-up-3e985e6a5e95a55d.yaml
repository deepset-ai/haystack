    Improved Toolset warm-up architecture for better encapsulation. The base
    Toolset.warm_up() method now warms up all tools by default, while subclasses
    can override it to customize initialization (e.g., setting up shared resources
    instead of warming individual tools). The warm_up_tools() utility function has
    been simplified to delegate to Toolset.warm_up().
