    Fixed warm_up_tools() utility function to properly warm up individual
    tools inside Toolset objects. Previously, only the Toolset's warm_up()
    method was called (which is a no-op), leaving individual tools
    uninitialized. Now both the Toolset and its contained tools are
    properly warmed up before pipeline execution."
