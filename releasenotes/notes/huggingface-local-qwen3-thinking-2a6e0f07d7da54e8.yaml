    `HuggingFaceLocalChatGenerator` now uses `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` as the default model, replacing the previous default.
    Additionally, a new `enable_thinking` parameter has been added to enable thinking mode in chat templates for
    thinking-capable models, allowing them to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing final responses.
