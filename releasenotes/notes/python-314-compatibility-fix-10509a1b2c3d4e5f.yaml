    Fixed Python 3.14 compatibility issues with type hint representation.
    In Python 3.14, typing.Optional and typing.Union are internally represented
    as UnionType, causing type serialization and comparison tests to fail.
    Updated _type_name() and serialize_type() functions to normalize UnionType
    representations to Optional/Union format for consistency across Python versions.
    This fixes 29 failing unit tests related to type hint representation.
