    `Pipeline.connect()` arguments have renamed for clarity. This is a breaking change if `connect` was called
    with keyword arguments only.
    `connect_from` and `connect_to` arguments have been renamed respectively to `sender` and `receiver`.
    The behaviour of `Pipeline.connect()` is not changed.
