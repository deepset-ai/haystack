features:
  - |
    The `AzureOpenAIDocumentEmbedder` component now inherits from the `OpenAIDocumentEmbedder` component,
    enabling asynchronous usage.
fixes:
  - |
    `OpenAIDocumentEmbedder` and `AzureOpenAIDocumentEmbedder` no longer replace newlines with spaces in the text to
    embed. This was only required for the discontinued v1 embedding models.
