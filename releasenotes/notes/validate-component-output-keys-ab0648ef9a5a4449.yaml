    Added runtime validation of component output keys in ``Pipeline.run()``. When a component
    returns keys that don't match its declared ``@component.output_types``, the pipeline now
    logs a warning identifying the misconfigured component. This helps diagnose issues where
    a component returns wrong keys, which previously caused a confusing "Pipeline Blocked"
    error pointing to the wrong (downstream) component.
