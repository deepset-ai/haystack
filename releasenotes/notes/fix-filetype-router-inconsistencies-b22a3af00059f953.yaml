fixes:

    `FileTypeRouter` has a new parameter `raise_on_failure` with default value to `False`. When set to `True`,
    `FileNotFoundError` is always raised for non-existent files. Previously, this exception was raised only when
    processing a non-existent file and the `meta` parameter was provided to `run()`.

    `MultiFileConverter` outputs a new key `failed` in the result dictionary, which contains a list of files that
    failed to convert.
    The `documents` output is included only if at least one file is successfully converted. Previously, `documents`
    could still be present but empty if a file with a supported MIME type was provided but did not actually exist.
