    `FileTypeRouter` has a new parameter `raise_on_failure` with default value to `False`. When set to `True`, `FileNotFoundError` is always raised for non-existent files. Currently, it only
    happens when the parameter `meta` in the run() is provided. This will be changed in a future release to always raise `FileNotFoundError` for non-existent files when `raise_on_failure` is set to `True`.
