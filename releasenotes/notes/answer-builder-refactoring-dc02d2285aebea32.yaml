    The `AnswerBuilder` component now exposes a new parameter `return_only_referenced_documents` (default: True) that
    controls if only documents referenced in the `replies` are returned.
    Returned documents include two new fields in the `meta` dictionary:
    - `source_index`: the 1-based index of the document in the input list
    - `referenced`: a boolean value indicating if the document was referenced in the `replies` (only present
    if the `reference_pattern` parameter is provided).
    These additions make it easier to display references and other sources within a RAG pipeline.
