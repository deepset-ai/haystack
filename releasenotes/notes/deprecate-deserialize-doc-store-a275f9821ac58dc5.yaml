deprecations:
  - |
    ``deserialize_document_store_in_init_params_inplace`` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Haystack.
    It is no longer used internally and should not be used in new code. The deserialization of DocumentStores is handled automatically now by default_from_dict.
