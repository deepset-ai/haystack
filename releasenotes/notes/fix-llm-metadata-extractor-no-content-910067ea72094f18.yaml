    Fixed a bug  in the `LLMMetadataExtractor` that occurred when
    processing `Document` objects with `None` or empty string content. The
    component now gracefully handles these cases by marking such documents as
    failed and providing an appropriate error message in their metadata, without
    attempting an LLM call.
