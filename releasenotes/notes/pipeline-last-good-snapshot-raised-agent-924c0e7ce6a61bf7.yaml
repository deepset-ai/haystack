    Fixed a serialization issue related to function objects in a pipeline; now they are converted to type None (functions cannot be serialized).
    This was preventing the successful setting of breakpoints in agents and their use as a resume point.
    If an error occurs during an Agent execution, for instance, during tool calling. In that case, a snapshot of the last successful step is raised, allowing the caller to catch it
    to inspect the possible reason for the crash and use it to resume the pipeline execution from that point onwards.
