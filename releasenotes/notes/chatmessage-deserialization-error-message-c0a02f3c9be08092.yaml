    Reintroduce verbose error message when deserializing a `ChatMessage` with invalid content parts.
    While LLMs may still generate messages in the wrong format, this error provides guidance on the expected structure,
    making retries easier and more reliable during agent runs.
    The error message was unintentionally removed during a previous refactoring.
