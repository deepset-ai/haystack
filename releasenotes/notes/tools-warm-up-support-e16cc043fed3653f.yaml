    Added a `warm_up()` function to the `Tool` dataclass, allowing tools to perform resource-intensive initialization
    before execution. Tools and Toolsets can now override the `warm_up()` method to establish connections to
    remote services, load models, or perform other preparatory operations. The `ToolInvoker` and `Agent`
    automatically call `warm_up()` on their tools during their own warm-up phase, ensuring tools are ready
    before use.
