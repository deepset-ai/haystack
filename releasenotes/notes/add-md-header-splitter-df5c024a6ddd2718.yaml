    Introduced the `MarkdownHeaderSplitter` component:
      - Splits documents into chunks at Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, etc.), preserving header hierarchy as metadata.
      - Optionally infers and rewrites header levels for documents where header structure is ambiguous (e.g. documents parsed using Docling).
      - Supports secondary splitting (by word, passage, period, or line) for further chunking after header-based splitting using Haystack's `DocumentSplitter`.
      - Preserves and propagates metadata such as parent headers and page numbers.
      - Handles edge cases such as documents with no headers, empty content, and non-text documents.
