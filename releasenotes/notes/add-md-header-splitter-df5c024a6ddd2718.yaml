    Introduced the ``MarkdownHeaderSplitter`` component:
      - Splits documents into chunks at Markdown headers (``#``, ``##``, etc.), preserving header hierarchy as metadata.
      - Supports secondary splitting (by word, passage, period, or line) for further chunking after header-based splitting using Haystack's ``DocumentSplitter``.
      - Preserves and propagates metadata such as parent headers and page numbers.
      - Handles edge cases such as documents with no headers, empty content, and non-text documents.
