    Previously, flexible pipeline connections were not robust when the sender component returned a list containing a
    union of types. In flexible pipeline connections, if the receiver type is ``str`` or ``ChatMessage``, the first
    element of the list sent by the sender component is extracted and converted to the receiver type.

    In the previous version, ``list[str | int]`` was considered compatible with ``str``, which should not be the case.
    In fact, the sender component can legitimately return a list where the first element has type ``int``, which the
    receiver cannot handle.

    This is now fixed by ensuring that all possible element types of the sender list are compatible with the receiver
    type before considering the connection valid.
