    - For HuggingFaceAPIGenerator and HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator all additional key, value pairs passed in `api_params` are now passed to the initializations of the underlying Inference Clients. This allows passing of additional parameters to the clients like `timeout`, `headers`, `provider`, etc.
    - This means we now can easily specify a different inference provider by passing the `provider` key in `api_params`.
