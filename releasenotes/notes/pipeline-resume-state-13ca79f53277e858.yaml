    A snapshot of the last successful step is now saved when an error occurs during a `Pipeline` run. This allows you
    to inspect the snapshot, potentially identify and fix the error, and later resume the pipeline from that point
    onwards. Avoiding to re-run the entire pipeline from the start. Currently, only available in `Pipeline` and not yet
    in `AsyncPipeline`.
