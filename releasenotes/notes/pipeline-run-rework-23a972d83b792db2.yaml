  `Pipeline.run()` internal logic has been heavily reworked to be more robust and reliable
  than before.
  This new implementation makes it easier to run `Pipeline`s that have cycles in their graph.
  It also fixes some corner cases in `Pipeline`s that don't have any cycle.

    Fundamentally rework the internal logic of `Pipeline.run()`.
    The rework makes it more reliable and covers more use cases.
    We fixed some issues that made `Pipeline`s with cycles unpredictable
    and with unclear Components execution order.
