  - |
    Update ListJoiner to only optionally need list_type_ to be passed. By default it uses type List which acts like List[Any].
    - This allows the ListJoiner to combine any incoming lists into a single flattened list.
    - Users can still pass list_type_ if they would like to have stricter type validation in their pipelines.
