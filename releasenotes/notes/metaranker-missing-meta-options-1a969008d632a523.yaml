    Add a new `missing_meta` param to `MetaFieldRanker`, which determines what to do with
    documents that lack the ranked meta field. Supported values are `"bottom"` (which
    puts documents with missing meta at the bottom of the sorted list), `"top"` (which puts them
    at the top), and `"drop"` (which removes them from the results entirely).
