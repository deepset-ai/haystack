    A variety of improvements have been made so an Agent component can be directly used in ComponentTool enabling straightforward building of Multi-Agent systems.
    These improvements include:
    - Adding a `last_message` field to the Agent's output which returns the last generated ChatMessage.
    - Improving the `_default_output_handler` in the `ToolInvoker` to try and first serialize the outputs in the tool result before converting it into a string. This is especially relevant for getting a better representation when stringifying dataclasses like ChatMessage.
