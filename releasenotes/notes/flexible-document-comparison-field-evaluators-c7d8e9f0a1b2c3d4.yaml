    Added ``document_comparison_field`` parameter to ``DocumentMRREvaluator``,
    ``DocumentMAPEvaluator``, and ``DocumentRecallEvaluator``.

    This allows users to compare documents using fields other than ``content``,
    such as ``id`` or metadata keys (via ``meta.<key>`` syntax).

    Previously, all three evaluators hardcoded ``doc.content`` for comparison,
    which did not work well when documents were chunked or when ground truth
    was identified by custom metadata fields.
