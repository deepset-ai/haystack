    Resolves a bug where the HuggingFaceTGIGenerator and HuggingFaceTGIChatGenerator encountered issues if provided
    with valid models that were not available on the HuggingFace inference API rate-limited tier. The fix, detailed
    in [GitHub issue #6816](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/6816) and its GitHub PR, ensures these
    components now correctly handle model availability, eliminating previous limitations.
