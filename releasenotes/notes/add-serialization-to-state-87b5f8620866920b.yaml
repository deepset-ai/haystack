features:

    - Introduced `serialize_value` and `deserialize_value` utility methods for consistent value (de)serialization across modules.

    - Moved the `State` class to the `agents.state` module and added serialization and deserialization capabilities.

deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated the `State` class in the `dataclasses` module. Users are encouraged to transition to the new version of `State` now located in the `agents.state` module. A deprecation warning has been added to guide this migration.
