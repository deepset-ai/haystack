    The `DOCXToDocument` converter now returns a `Document` object with DOCX metadata stored in the `meta` field as a
    dictionary under the key `docx`. Previously, the metadata was represented as a `DOCXMetadata` dataclass.
    This change does not impact reading from or writing to a Document Store.
