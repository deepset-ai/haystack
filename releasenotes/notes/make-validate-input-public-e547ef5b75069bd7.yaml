    Make the PipelineBase().validate_input method public so users can use it with the confidence that it won't receive breaking changes without warning.
    This method is useful for checking that all required connections in a pipeline have a connection and is automatically called in the run method of Pipeline.
    It is being exposed as public for users who would like to call this method before runtime to validate the pipeline.
