    We've added a `py.typed` file to Haystack to enable type information to be used by downstream projects, in line
    with PEP 561. This means Haystack's type hints will now be visible to type checkers in projects that depend on it.
    Haystack is primarily type checked using mypy (not pyright) and, despite our efforts, some type information can
    be incomplete or unreliable.
    If you use static type checking in your own project, you may notice some changes: previously, Haystack's types were
    effectively treated as `Any`, but now actual type information will be available and enforced.
