    Re-implement `InMemoryDocumentStore` BM25 search with incremental indexing by avoiding re-creating
    the entire inverse index for every new query. This change also removes the dependency on
    `haystack_bm25`. Please refer to [PR #7549](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/pull/7549)
    for the full context.
