features:
  - |
    Added a new parameter `additional_mimetypes` to the FileTypeRouter
    component.

    This allows users to specify additional MIME type mappings, ensuring
    correct

    file classification across different runtime environments and Python
    versions.
enhancements:
  - |
    Improved file type detection in FileTypeRouter, particularly for Microsoft
    Office file formats like .docx and .pptx. This enhancement ensures more
    consistent behavior across different environments, including AWS Lambda
    functions and systems without pre-installed office suites.
fixes:
  - |
    Addressed an issue where certain file types (e.g., .docx, .pptx) were
    incorrectly classified as 'unclassified' in environments with limited
    MIME type definitions, such as AWS Lambda functions.
