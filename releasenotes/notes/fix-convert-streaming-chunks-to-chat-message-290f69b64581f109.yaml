    Fix `_convert_streaming_chunks_to_chat_message` which is used to convert Haystack StreamingChunks into a Haystack ChatMessage. This fixes the scenario where one StreamingChunk contains two ToolCallDetlas in StreamingChunk.tool_calls. With this fix this correctly saves both ToolCallDeltas whereas before they were overwriting each other. This only occurs with some LLM providers like Mistral (and not OpenAI) due to how the provider returns tool calls.
