    Introduce the SentenceTransformersDocumentImageEmbedder, a component for computing Document embeddings from
    images using Sentence Transformers models such as OpenAI CLIP or Jina CLIP.
    Each Document must have a meta field that specifies the path an image or PDF file.
    The resulting embedding will be stored in the `embedding` field of the Document.
