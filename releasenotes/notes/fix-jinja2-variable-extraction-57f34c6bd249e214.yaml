    Fixes jinja2 variable detection in ``ConditionalRouter``, ``ChatPromptBuilder``, ``PromptBuilder`` and ``OutputAdapter`` by properly
    skipping variables that are assigned within the template.
    Previously under specific scenarios variables assigned within a template would falsely be picked up as input variables to the component.
    For more information you can check out the parent issue in the Jinja2 library here: https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/2069
