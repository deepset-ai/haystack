    Improved pipeline "possibly blocked" error messages to point to the most upstream
    blocked component instead of a downstream component. When a pipeline is blocked,
    the error message now uses topological sorting to identify the root cause component
    that is actually blocked, rather than reporting a component that is blocked as a
    consequence of an upstream blockage. This makes debugging pipeline configuration
    issues much easier by directing users to the actual source of the problem.
