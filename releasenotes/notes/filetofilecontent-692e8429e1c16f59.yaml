features:
  - |
    Added the `FileToFileContent` component, which converts local files into ``FileContent`` objects. These can be
    embedded into ``ChatMessage`` to pass to an LLM.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue in ``OpenAIChatGenerator`` and ``OpenAIResponsesChatGenerator`` where passing a ``FileContent``
    object without a filename would raise an error. A fallback filename is now automatically used instead.
