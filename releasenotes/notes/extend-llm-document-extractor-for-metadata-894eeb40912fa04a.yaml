    The ``LLMDocumentContentExtractor`` now also supports metadata extraction. It can run in three modes: "content", "metadata", or "both". Extracting only content, metadata, or both for a given Document.
    The three modes are chosen at init and optionally overridden at runtime via ``run(..., extraction_mode=...)``.
