    The ``LLMDocumentContentExtractor`` now extracts both content and metadata from image-based documents.
    When the LLM returns JSON, ``document_content`` fills the document body and other keys are merged into metadata; plain text is still used as content.
    If an error occurs the field ``extraction_error``is added to metadata with the error message.
