features:
  - |
    Added ``HAYSTACK_PIPELINE_SNAPSHOT_SAVE_ENABLED`` environment variable.
    When set to ``"true"`` or ``"1"``, pipeline snapshots are saved to disk. Disabled by default.
    Note: Custom ``snapshot_callback`` functions are still invoked regardless of this setting.
upgrade:
  - |
    Pipeline snapshot file saving is now **disabled by default**. You must now explicitly enable it by setting the
    environment variable ``HAYSTACK_PIPELINE_SNAPSHOT_SAVE_ENABLED=true``.
