    The ``return_empty_on_no_match`` parameter has been fully removed from the ``RegexTextExtractor`` component.
    In Haystack 2.22.0, this parameter was ignored. Starting with Haystack 2.23.0, passing this parameter during
    component initialization will raise an error.
    During pipeline deserialization, the parameter is ignored to avoid breaking existing pipelines.
