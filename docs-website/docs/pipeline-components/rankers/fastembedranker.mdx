# FastembedRanker

Use this component to rank documents based on their similarity to the query using cross-encoder models supported by FastEmbed.

| **Most common position in a pipeline** | In a query pipeline, after a component that returns a list of documents such as a [Retriever](../../../docs/pipeline-components/retrievers.mdx) |
| **Mandatory run variables** | “documents”: A list of documents  <br /> <br />”query”: A query string |
| **Output variables** | “documents”: A list of documents |

## Overview

`FastembedRanker` ranks the documents based on how similar they are to the query.  It uses [cross-encoder models supported by FastEmbed](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/).  
Based on ONXX Runtime, FastEmbed provides a fast experience on standard CPU machines.

`FastembedRanker` is most useful in query pipelines such as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline or a document search pipeline to ensure the retrieved documents are ordered by relevance. You can use it after a Retriever (such as the [`InMemoryEmbeddingRetriever`](../retrievers/inmemoryembeddingretriever.mdx)) to improve the search results. When using `FastembedRanker` with a Retriever, consider setting the Retriever's `top_k` to a small number. This way, the Ranker will have fewer documents to process, which can help make your pipeline faster.

By default, this component uses the `Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` model, but you can switch to a different model by adjusting the `model` parameter when initializing the Ranker. For details on different initialization settings, check out the [API reference](/reference/fastembed-embedders) page.

### Compatible Models

You can find the compatible models in the [FastEmbed documentation](https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models/).

### Installation

To start using this integration with Haystack, install the package with:

```shell
pip install fastembed-haystack
```

### Parameters

You can set the path where the model is stored in a cache directory. You can also set the number of threads a single `onnxruntime` session can use.

```python
cache_dir= "/your_cacheDirectory"
ranker = FastembedRanker(
	model="Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2",
	cache_dir=cache_dir,
	threads=2
)
```

If you want to use the data parallel encoding, you can set the parameters `parallel` and `batch_size`.

- If `parallel` > 1, data-parallel encoding will be used. This is recommended for offline encoding of large datasets.
- If `parallel` is 0, use all available cores.
- If None, don't use data-parallel processing; use default `onnxruntime` threading instead.

## Usage

### On its own

This example uses `FastembedRanker` to rank two simple documents. To run the Ranker, pass a `query`, provide the `documents`, and set the number of documents to return in the `top_k` parameter.

```python
from haystack import Document
from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.fastembed import FastembedRanker

docs = [Document(content="Paris"), Document(content="Berlin")]

ranker = FastembedRanker()
ranker.warm_up()

ranker.run(query="City in France", documents=docs, top_k=1)
```

### In a pipeline

Below is an example of a pipeline that retrieves documents from an `InMemoryDocumentStore` based on keyword search using `InMemoryBM25Retriever`. It then uses the `FastembedRanker` to rank the retrieved documents according to their similarity to the query. The pipeline uses the default settings of the Ranker.

```python
from haystack import Document, Pipeline
from haystack.components.retrievers.in_memory import InMemoryBM25Retriever
from haystack.document_stores.in_memory import InMemoryDocumentStore
from haystack_integrations.components.rankers.fastembed import FastembedRanker

docs = [
    Document(content="Paris is in France"),
    Document(content="Berlin is in Germany"),
    Document(content="Lyon is in France"),
]
document_store = InMemoryDocumentStore()
document_store.write_documents(docs)

retriever = InMemoryBM25Retriever(document_store=document_store)
ranker = FastembedRanker()

document_ranker_pipeline = Pipeline()
document_ranker_pipeline.add_component(instance=retriever, name="retriever")
document_ranker_pipeline.add_component(instance=ranker, name="ranker")

document_ranker_pipeline.connect("retriever.documents", "ranker.documents")

query = "Cities in France"
res = document_ranker_pipeline.run(data={"retriever": {"query": query, "top_k": 3}, "ranker": {"query": query, "top_k": 2}})
```
