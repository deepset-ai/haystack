## Overview

`GitHubRepoForker` takes a GitHub issue URL, extracts the repository information, creates or syncs a fork of that repository, and optionally creates an issue-specific branch. It's particularly useful for automated workflows that need to create pull requests or work with repository forks.

Key features:

- **Auto-sync**: Automatically syncs existing forks with the upstream repository
- **Branch creation**: Creates issue-specific branches (e.g., "fix-123" for issue #123)
- **Completion waiting**: Optionally waits for fork creation to complete
- **Fork management**: Handles existing forks intelligently

### Authorization

This component requires GitHub authentication with a personal access token. You can set the token using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, or pass it directly during initialization via the `github_token` parameter.

To create a personal access token, visit [GitHub's token settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Make sure to grant the appropriate permissions for repository forking and management.

### Installation

Install the GitHub integration with pip:

```shell
pip install github-haystack
```

## Usage

:::info

### On its own

```python
from haystack_integrations.components.connectors.github import GitHubRepoForker

forker = GitHubRepoForker()
result = forker.run(url="https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123")

print(result)
```

```bash
{'repo': 'owner/repo', 'issue_branch': 'fix-123'}
```
