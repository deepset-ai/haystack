## Overview

The `OpenAPIConnector` is a component within the Haystack ecosystem that allows direct invocation of REST endpoints defined in an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification. It acts as a bridge between Haystack pipelines and any REST API that follows the OpenAPI standard, enabling dynamic method calls, authentication, and parameter handling.

To use the `OpenAPIConnector`, ensure that you have the `openapi-llm` dependency installed:

```shell
pip install openapi-llm
```

Unlike [OpenAPIServiceConnector](openapiserviceconnector.mdx), which works with LLMs, `OpenAPIConnector` directly calls REST endpoints using explicit input arguments.

## Usage

### On its own

You can initialize and use the `OpenAPIConnector` on its own by passing an OpenAPI specification and other parameters:

```python
from haystack.utils import Secret
from haystack.components.connectors.openapi import OpenAPIConnector

connector = OpenAPIConnector(
    openapi_spec="https://bit.ly/serperdev_openapi",
    credentials=Secret.from_env_var("SERPERDEV_API_KEY"),
    service_kwargs={"config_factory": my_custom_config_factory}
)

response = connector.run(
    operation_id="search",
    arguments={"q": "Who was Nikola Tesla?"}
)
```

#### Output

The `OpenAPIConnector` returns a dictionary containing the service response:

```json
{
    "response": { // here goes REST endpoint response JSON
    }
}
```

### In a pipeline

The `OpenAPIConnector` can be integrated into a Haystack pipeline to interact with OpenAPI services. For example, here’s how you can link the `OpenAPIConnector` to a pipeline:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline
from haystack.components.connectors.openapi import OpenAPIConnector
from haystack.dataclasses.chat_message import ChatMessage
from haystack.utils import Secret

## Initialize the OpenAPIConnector
connector = OpenAPIConnector(
    openapi_spec="https://bit.ly/serperdev_openapi",
    credentials=Secret.from_env_var("SERPERDEV_API_KEY")
)

## Create a ChatMessage from the user
user_message = ChatMessage.from_user(text="Who was Nikola Tesla?")

## Define the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()
pipeline.add_component("openapi_connector", connector)

## Run the pipeline
response = pipeline.run(
    data={"openapi_connector": {"operation_id": "search", "arguments": {"q": user_message.text}}}
)

## Extract the answer from the response
answer = response.get("openapi_connector", {}).get("response", {})
print(answer)
```
