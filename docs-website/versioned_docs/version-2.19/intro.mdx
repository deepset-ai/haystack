Haystack is an open-source AI orchestration framework that you can use to build powerful, production-ready applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) for various use cases. Whether youâ€™re creating autonomous agents, multimodal apps, or scalable RAG systems, Haystack provides the tools to move from idea to production easily.

Haystack is designed in a modular way, allowing you to combine the best technology from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and open-source projects like Hugging Face's Transformers or Elasticsearch.

The core foundation of Haystack consists of components and pipelines, along with Document Stores, Agents, Tools, and many integrations. Read more about Haystack concepts in the [Haystack Concepts Overview](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/components_overview).

Supported by an engaged community of developers, Haystack has grown into a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for LLM-based development.
