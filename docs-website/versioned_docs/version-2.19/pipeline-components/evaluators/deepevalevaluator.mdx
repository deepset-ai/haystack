# DeepEvalEvaluator

The DeepEvalEvaluator evaluates Haystack pipelines using LLM-based metrics. It supports metrics like answer relevancy, faithfulness, contextual relevance, and more.

| --- | --- |
| **Most common position in a pipeline** | On its own or in an evaluation pipeline. To be used after a separate pipeline has generated the inputs for the Evaluator. |
| **Mandatory init variables** | `metric`: One of the DeepEval metrics to use for evaluation |
| **Mandatory run variables** | “\*\*inputs”: A keyword arguments dictionary containing the expected inputs. The expected inputs will change based on the metric you are evaluating. See below for more details. |
| **Output variables** | “results”: A nested list of metric results. There can be one or more results, depending on the metric. Each result is a dictionary containing:  <br /> <br />- `name` - The name of the metric   - `score` - The score of the metric   - `explanation` - An optional explanation of the score |

DeepEval is an evaluation framework that provides a number of LLM-based evaluation metrics. You can use the `DeepEvalEvaluator` component to evaluate a Haystack pipeline, such as a retrieval-augmented generated pipeline, against one of the metrics provided by DeepEval.

## Supported Metrics

DeepEval supports a number of metrics, which we expose through the [DeepEval metric enumeration.](/reference/integrations-deepeval#deepevalmetric) [`DeepEvalEvaluator`](/reference/integrations-deepeval#deepevalevaluator) in Haystack supports the metrics listed below with the expected `metric_params` while initializing the Evaluator. Many metrics use OpenAI models and require you to set an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. For a complete guide on these metrics, visit the [DeepEval documentation](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| `ANSWER_RELEVANCY` | `model: str` |
| `FAITHFULNESS` | `model: str` |
| `CONTEXTUAL_PRECISION` | `model: str` |
| `CONTEXTUAL_RECALL` | `model: str` |
| `CONTEXTUAL_RELEVANCE` | `model: str` |

## Parameters Overview

To initialize a `DeepEvalEvaluator`, you need to provide the following parameters :

- `metric`: A `DeepEvalMetric`.
- `metric_params`: Optionally, if the metric calls for any additional parameters, you should provide them here.

## Usage

To use the `DeepEvalEvaluator`, you first need to install the integration:

```bash
pip install deepeval-haystack
```

To use the `DeepEvalEvaluator` you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize the `DeepEvalEvaluator` while providing the correct `metric_params` for the metric you are using.
2. Run the `DeepEvalEvaluator` on its own or in a pipeline by providing the expected input for the metric you are using.

### Examples

**Evaluate Faithfulness**

To create a faithfulness evaluation pipeline:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline
from haystack_integrations.components.evaluators.deepeval import DeepEvalEvaluator, DeepEvalMetric

pipeline = Pipeline()
evaluator = DeepEvalEvaluator(
    metric=DeepEvalMetric.FAITHFULNESS,
    metric_params={"model": "gpt-4"},
)
pipeline.add_component("evaluator", evaluator)
```

To run the evaluation pipeline, you should have the _expected inputs_ for the metric ready at hand. This metric expects a list of `questions` and `contexts`. These should come from the results of the pipeline you want to evaluate.

```python
results = pipeline.run({"evaluator": {"questions": ["When was the Rhodes Statue built?", "Where is the Pyramid of Giza?"],
                                      "contexts": [["Context for question 1"], ["Context for question 2"]],
                                      "responses": ["Response for question 1", "Response for question 2"]}})
```
