| [CohereRanker](rankers/cohereranker.mdx) | Ranks documents based on their similarity to the query using Cohere rerank models. |
| [FastembedRanker](rankers/fastembedranker.mdx) | Ranks documents based on their similarity to the query using cross-encoder models supported by FastEmbed. |
| [HuggingFaceTEIRanker](rankers/huggingfaceteiranker.mdx) | Ranks documents based on their similarity to the query using a Text Embeddings Inference (TEI) API endpoint. |
| [JinaRanker](rankers/jinaranker.mdx) | Ranks documents based on their similarity to the query using Jina AI models. |
| [LostInTheMiddleRanker](rankers/lostinthemiddleranker.mdx) | Positions the most relevant documents at the beginning and at the end of the resulting list while placing the least relevant documents in the middle, based on a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172). |
