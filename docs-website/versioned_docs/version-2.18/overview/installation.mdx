# Installation

See how to quickly install Haystack with pip or conda.

## Package Installation

Use [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to install only the Haystack code:

```shell
pip install haystack-ai
```

Alternatively, you can use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/):

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge/label/haystack-ai_rc
conda install haystack-ai
```

Warning

Installing `farm-haystack` and `haystack-ai` in the same Python environment (virtualenv, Colab, or system) causes problems.

Installing both packages in the same environment can somehow work or fail in obscure ways. We suggest installing only one of these packages per Python environment. Make sure that you remove both packages if they are installed in the same environment, followed by installing only one of them:

```bash
pip uninstall -y farm-haystack haystack-ai
pip install haystack-ai
```

If you have any questions, please reach out to us on the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VBpFzsgRVF).

### Optional Dependencies

Some components in Haystack rely on additional optional dependencies.
To keep the installation lightweight, these are not included by default – only the essentials are installed.
If you use a feature that requires an optional dependency that hasn't been installed, Haystack will raise an error that instructs you to install missing dependencies, for example:

```shell
ImportError: "Haystack failed to import the optional dependency 'pypdf'. Run 'pip install pypdf'.
```
