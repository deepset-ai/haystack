# FAQ

Here are the answers to the questions people frequently ask about Haystack.

### How can I make sure that my GPU is being engaged when I use Haystack?

You will want to ensure that a CUDA enabled GPU is being engaged when Haystack is running (you can check by running `nvidia-smi -l` on your command line). Components which can be sped up by GPU have a `device` argument in their constructor. For more details, check the [Device Management](../concepts/device-management.mdx) page.

### Are you tracking my Haystack usage?

We only collect _anonymous_ usage statistics of Haystack pipeline components. Read more about telemetry in Haystack or how you can opt out on the [Telemetry](telemetry.mdx) page.

### How can I ask my questions around Haystack?

For general questions, we recommend joining the [Haystack Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/xYvH6drSmA)or using [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions), where the community and maintainers can help. You can also explore [tutorials](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/40_building_chat_application_with_function_calling) and [examples](https://haystack.deepset.ai/cookbook/tools_support) on our website to find more info.
