## Overview

Top-P (nucleus) sampling is a method that helps identify and select a subset of documents based on their cumulative probabilities. Instead of choosing a fixed number of documents, this method focuses on a specified percentage of the highest cumulative probabilities within a list of documents. To put it simply, `TopPSampler` provides a way to efficiently select the most relevant documents based on their similarity to a given query.

The practical goal of the `TopPSampler` is to return a list of documents that, in sum, have a score larger than the `top_p` value. So, for example, when `top_p` is set to a high value, more documents will be returned, which can result in more varied outputs. The value is typically set between 0 and 1. By default, the component uses documents' `score` fields to look at the similarity scores.

The component’s `run()` method takes in a set of documents, calculates the similarity scores between the query and the documents, and then filters the documents based on the cumulative probability of these scores. 

## Usage

### On its own

```python
from haystack import Document
from haystack.components.samplers import TopPSampler

sampler = TopPSampler(top_p=0.99, score_field="similarity_score")
docs = [
    Document(content="Berlin", meta={"similarity_score": -10.6}),
    Document(content="Belgrade", meta={"similarity_score": -8.9}),
    Document(content="Sarajevo", meta={"similarity_score": -4.6}),
]
output = sampler.run(documents=docs)
docs = output["documents"]
print(docs)
```
