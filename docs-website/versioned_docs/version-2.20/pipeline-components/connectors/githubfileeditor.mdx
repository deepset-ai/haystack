## Overview

`GitHubFileEditor` supports multiple file operations, including editing existing files, creating new files, deleting files, and undoing recent changes.

There are four main commands:

- **EDIT**: Edit an existing file by replacing specific content
- **CREATE**: Create a new file with specified content
- **DELETE**: Delete an existing file
- **UNDO**: Revert the last commit if made by the same user

### Authorization

This component requires GitHub authentication with a personal access token. You can set the token using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, or pass it directly during initialization via the `github_token` parameter.

To create a personal access token, visit [GitHub's token settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Make sure to grant the appropriate permissions for repository access and content management.

### Installation

Install the GitHub integration with pip:

```shell
pip install github-haystack
```

### On its own

Editing an existing file:

```python
from haystack_integrations.components.connectors.github import GitHubFileEditor, Command

editor = GitHubFileEditor(repo="owner/repo", branch="main")

result = editor.run(
    command=Command.EDIT,
    payload={
        "path": "src/example.py",
        "original": "def old_function():",
        "replacement": "def new_function():",
        "message": "Renamed function for clarity"
    }
)

print(result)
```

```bash
{'result': 'Edit successful'}
```

Creating a new file:

```python
from haystack_integrations.components.connectors.github import GitHubFileEditor, Command

editor = GitHubFileEditor(repo="owner/repo")

result = editor.run(
    command=Command.CREATE,
    payload={
        "path": "docs/new_file.md",
        "content": "# New Documentation\n\nThis is a new file.",
        "message": "Add new documentation file"
    }
)

print(result)
```

```bash
{'result': 'File created successfully'}
```
