## Overview

`GitHubIssueCommenterTool` wraps the [`GitHubIssueCommenter`](../../pipeline-components/connectors/githubissuecommenter.mdx) component, providing a tool interface for use in agent workflows and tool-based pipelines.

The tool takes a GitHub issue URL and comment text, then posts the comment to the specified issue using the GitHub API. This requires authentication since posting comments is an authenticated operation.

### Parameters

- `name` is _optional_ and defaults to "issue_commenter". Specifies the name of the tool.
- `description` is _optional_ and provides context to the LLM about what the tool does.
- `github_token` is _mandatory_ and must be a GitHub personal access token for API authentication. The default setting uses the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- `raise_on_failure` is _optional_ and defaults to `True`. If False, errors are returned instead of raising exceptions.
- `retry_attempts` is _optional_ and defaults to `2`. Number of retry attempts for failed requests.

## Usage

Install the GitHub integration to use the `GitHubIssueCommenterTool`:

```shell
pip install github-haystack
```

:::info
Repository Placeholder

To run the following code snippets, you need to replace the `owner/repo` with your own GitHub repository name.

### On its own

Basic usage to comment on an issue:

```python
from haystack_integrations.tools.github import GitHubIssueCommenterTool

tool = GitHubIssueCommenterTool()
result = tool.invoke(
    url="https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123",
    comment="Thanks for reporting this issue! We'll look into it."
)

print(result)
```

```bash
{'success': True}
```

### With an Agent

You can use `GitHubIssueCommenterTool` with the [Agent](../../pipeline-components/agents-1/agent.mdx) component. The Agent will automatically invoke the tool when needed to post comments on GitHub issues.

```python
from haystack.components.generators.chat import OpenAIChatGenerator
from haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage
from haystack.components.agents import Agent
from haystack_integrations.tools.github import GitHubIssueCommenterTool

comment_tool = GitHubIssueCommenterTool(name="github_issue_commenter")

agent = Agent(
    chat_generator=OpenAIChatGenerator(),
    tools=[comment_tool],
    exit_conditions=["text"]
)

agent.warm_up()
response = agent.run(messages=[
    ChatMessage.from_user("Please post a helpful comment on this GitHub issue: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 acknowledging the bug report and mentioning that we're investigating")
])

print(response["last_message"].text)
```

```bash
I have posted the comment on the GitHub issue, acknowledging the bug report and mentioning that the team is investigating the problem. If you need anything else, feel free to ask!
```
