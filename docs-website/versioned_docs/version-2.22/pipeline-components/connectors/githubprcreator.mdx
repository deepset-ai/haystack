## Overview

`GitHubPRCreator` takes a GitHub issue URL and creates a pull request from your fork to the original repository, automatically linking it to the specified issue. It's designed to work with existing forks and assumes you have already made changes in a branch.

Key features:

- **Cross-repository PRs**: Creates pull requests from your fork to the original repository
- **Issue linking**: Automatically links the PR to the specified GitHub issue
- **Draft support**: Option to create draft pull requests
- **Fork validation**: Checks that the required fork exists before creating the PR

As optional parameters, you can set `body` to provide a pull request description and the boolean parameter `draft` to open a draft pull request.

### Authorization

This component requires GitHub authentication with a personal access token from the fork owner. You can set the token using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable, or pass it directly during initialization via the `github_token` parameter.

To create a personal access token, visit [GitHub's token settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Make sure to grant the appropriate permissions for repository access and pull request creation.

### Installation

Install the GitHub integration with pip:

```shell
pip install github-haystack
```

## Usage

    title="Fix issue #123",
    body="This PR addresses issue #123 by implementing the requested changes.",
    branch="fix-123",  # Branch in your fork with the changes
    base="main"        # Branch in original repo to merge into
