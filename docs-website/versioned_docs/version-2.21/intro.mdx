# Introduction to Haystack

Haystack is an **open-source AI framework** for building production-ready **AI Agents**, **powerful RAG applications** and **scalable multimodal search systems**. Build pipelines using reusable components, each responsible for specific tasks. Customize and extend pipelines to match your requirements. Learn more about Haystack and how it works.

Haystack is an open-source AI orchestration framework that you can use to build powerful, production-ready applications with Large Language Models (LLMs) for various use cases. Whether you’re creating autonomous agents, multimodal apps, or scalable RAG systems, Haystack provides the tools to move from idea to production easily.

Haystack is designed in a modular way, allowing you to combine the best technology from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and open-source projects like Hugging Face's Transformers.

The core foundation of Haystack consists of components and pipelines, along with Document Stores, Agents, Tools, and many integrations. Read more about Haystack concepts in the [Haystack Concepts Overview](concepts/concepts-overview.mdx).

Supported by an engaged community of developers, Haystack has grown into a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for LLM-based development.
