# Package Installation

Use [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) to install only the Haystack code:

```shell
pip install haystack-ai
```

Alternatively, you can use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/):

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge/label/haystack-ai_rc
conda install haystack-ai
```

> ðŸš§ Warning
>
> Installing `farm-haystack` and `haystack-ai` in the same Python environment (virtualenv, Colab, or system) causes problems.
>
> Installing both packages in the same environment can somehow work or fail in obscure ways. We suggest installing only one of these packages per Python environment. Make sure that you remove both packages if they are installed in the same environment, followed by installing only one of them:
>
> ```bash
> pip uninstall -y farm-haystack haystack-ai
> pip install haystack-ai
> ```
>
> If you have any questions, please reach out to us on the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VBpFzsgRVF).
