## What to build with Haystack

- **Ask questions in natural language** and find granular answers in your own documents.
- Perform **semantic search** and retrieve documents according to meaning not keywords
- Use **off-the-shelf models** or **fine-tune** them to your own domain.
- Use **user feedback** to evaluate, benchmark and continuously improve your live models.
- Leverage existing **knowledge bases** and better handle the long tail of queries that **chatbots** receive.
- **Automate processes** by automatically applying a list of questions to new documents and using the extracted answers.

## Core Features

-   **Latest models**: Utilize all latest transformer based models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa, MiniLM) for extractive QA, generative QA and document retrieval.
-   **Modular**: Multiple choices to fit your tech stack and use case. Pick your favorite database, file converter or modeling framwework.
-   **Open**: 100% compatible with HuggingFace's model hub. Tight interfaces to other frameworks (e.g. Transformers, FARM, sentence-transformers)
-   **Scalable**: Scale to millions of docs via retrievers, production-ready backends like Elasticsearch / FAISS and a fastAPI REST API
-   **End-to-End**: All tooling in one place: file conversion, cleaning, splitting, training, eval, inference, labeling ...
-   **Developer friendly**: Easy to debug, extend and modify.
-   **Customizable**: Fine-tune models to your own domain or implement your custom DocumentStore.
-   **Continuous Learning**: Collect new training data via user feedback in production & improve your models continuously
