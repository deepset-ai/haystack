It was written by series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and directed by Miguel Sapochnik. Cersei Lannister plots to destroy all her immediate enemies with one swift stroke; Arya Stark gets revenge; Jon Snow is declared King in the North by the lords of the Northern houses; Bran Stark learns that Jon is actually the son of Lyanna Stark; Samwell Tarly arrives at the Citadel; and Daenerys Targaryen begins heading to Westeros alongside Tyrion Lannister, her entire army, the Ironborn loyal to Yara Greyjoy, the Tyrells, the Sand Snakes, and her three dragons. \"The Winds of Winter\" received universal acclaim from critics, listing it as one of the series' best episodes as well as one of the best television episodes of all time. Critics praised the Great Sept explosion, Lena Headey's performance, Arya's revenge on the Freys, the resolution to the Tower of Joy flashback, and Daenerys going to Westeros as highlights of the episode. In the United States, the episode achieved a viewership of 8.89 million in its initial broadcast, making it the highest rated episode in the series' history at that time. It was nominated for several awards, including Headey for the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress, and won the Emmy for Outstanding Costumes. This episode marks the final appearance for Natalie Dormer (Queen Margaery Tyrell), Dean-Charles Chapman (King Tommen Baratheon), Finn Jones (Ser Loras Tyrell), Eugene Simon (Lancel Lannister), Ian Gelder (Kevan Lannister), Jonathan Pryce (The High Sparrow), Roger Ashton-Griffiths (Mace Tyrell), Julian Glover (Grand Maester Pycelle), and Michiel Huisman (Daario Naharis). ==Plot==\n\n===At the Twins===\nWalder Frey celebrates the recapture of Riverrun with the Lannisters. Some time later, Walder eats dinner alone, wondering why his sons have yet to arrive. His servant reveals that she baked them into the meat pie he has been eating, and then removes her face to reveal that she is actually Arya Stark, before cutting Walder's throat. ===In King's Landing===\nOn the day of Cersei's and Loras' trials, the High Sparrow, the Faith and the court gather in the Great Sept. However Cersei remains in her chambers, while Ser Gregor prevents Tommen from leaving his quarters. Meanwhile, Qyburn summons Grand Maester Pycelle to his laboratory, where his child spies stab Pycelle to death. Loras confesses to his crimes and atones by giving up his name and title, and joins the Faith Militant. After Cersei fails to appear, Lancel is sent to retrieve her. Lancel follows one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, and finds a wildfire cache about to explode, but is stabbed before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. The sole survivor of the Faith Militant's destruction is Septa Unella, whom Cersei leaves with Gregor to be tortured. Tommen witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep; after being informed of Margaery's death, he takes his own life by jumping out of a window. Cersei orders Qyburn to cremate his remains and scatter the ashes at the ruins of the Great Sept, where Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tywin were interred. As Jaime and Bronn return from the Riverlands, they view the burning ruins of the Great Sept. Jaime subsequently arrives at the Red Keep to witness Cersei being crowned Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. ===At Oldtown===\nAs Samwell and Gilly arrive at Oldtown, they witness the Citadel releasing countless white ravens to announce the arrival of winter. They report to the Citadel, and Sam is scheduled to meet the Archmaester. In the meantime, Sam is granted access to the library. ===At Winterfell===\nDavos confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre admits to burning Shireen alive, but points out that she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was defeated anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her to admit that she was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon to execute Melisandre, but she counters that she will be useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and he and Davos threaten to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other. Littlefinger privately meets with Sansa in the godswood. He reveals that his ultimate goal is to sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa at his side. Sansa rejects his offer and leaves. Later, Jon gathers the various Northern lords, the Knights of the Vale, and the Free Folk to plan for the fight against the White Walkers. Lyanna Mormont shames the Northern lords that did not come to Jon's aid. All lords present (except, to Sansa's concern, Littlefinger) declare a reluctant Jon the new King in the North. ===In Dorne===\nA grieving Olenna meets with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes concerning the possibility of an alliance against Cersei. To Olenna's surprise, Ellaria presents Varys, who offers Olenna vengeance by allying with Daenerys. ===Beyond the Wall===\nBran, Meera, and Benjen arrive near the Wall. Benjen takes his leave, as the Wall's magical protection also prevents him from being able to pass. Meera assists Bran to a weirwood tree and he re-enters the vision of Ned Stark at the Tower of Joy. Ned finds his sister Lyanna covered in blood from childbirth. With her dying breath, Lyanna pleads with Ned to protect her son, particularly from Robert Baratheon, whom she insists will kill her son if he were to know his true parentage. Ned is given the infant, who is revealed to be Jon Snow. ===In Meereen===\nDaenerys informs Daario that he will not accompany her to Westeros, as she needs him to keep order in Meereen while she invades Westeros.",

        "content": "I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with.\" Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, \"There is no 'decoration' to Cersei.\" She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a \"deadness inside her.\" Clapton, in a separate interview, was also asked about the meaning and representation of Cersei's crown, saying \"I chose to make it in silver with just wisps of gold to try to show her isolation, her mental disentangling from her family. There is no reference to Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn't have to try and prove a link. The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted — its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire. She has made it her own — she is reborn.\" Clapton revealed as well that King Tommen Baratheon's costume was intended to show how heavily his responsibilities weigh on him, as he is weighted down with jeweled finery, with Clapton saying \"He was a nice boy. Too nice for this.\" ===Musical score===\nComposer Ramin Djawadi created the episode's musical score. The musical score for \"The Winds of Winter\" was composed by Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi has worked on the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created for the beginning of the episode, titled \"Light of the Seven\", which largely consisted of piano, something unusual for the series. Djawadi stated, \"The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really in the language of the ''Game of Thrones'' score.\" He continued, \"It all felt like a perfect fit. What's great about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes long. I knew I had to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the anticipation from there, without tipping in either direction.\" Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, \"The Rains of Castamere\", in order to create more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying \"The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And the organ as well.\" Asked in a separate interview about the overall process of composing the music and how it is used in the episode, Djawadi revealed \"I sit with David and Dan and we do what's called a spotting session where we watch the entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop. Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about ''Game of Thrones'' is that the positioning of the music is so well done, because it's not overdone. When the music cuts in, it really has something to say.\" \"Light of the Seven\" reached No. 1 on Billboard's Spotify Viral 50 chart on its release. The episode also featured the show's main theme during the \"King in the North\" scene with Jon Snow at Winterfell. Critical praise was directed towards the musical score for the episode, with Lili Loofbourow of ''The Week'' calling it the \"real winner\" of the season finale. ==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\n\"The Winds of Winter\" was viewed by 8.89 million American households on its initial viewing on HBO, significantly higher than the previous week's rating of 7.66 million viewers for the season's penultimate episode \"Battle of the Bastards\", making it the most watched episode in the series' history, until surpassed by the seventh-season premiere, \"Dragonstone\". The episode also acquired a 4.35 rating in the 18–49 demographic, making it the highest rated show on cable television of the night, and topping its previous best of 4.0, set twice earlier in the season. In the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 2.498 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, making it the highest-rated broadcast that week on its channel. It also received 0.153 million timeshift viewers. ===Critical reception===\n\n\"The Winds of Winter\" received acclaim from both critics and viewers, praising it as one of the series' best episodes. It has received a 99% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 58 reviews with an average score of 9.7 out of 10. The site's consensus reads \"'The Winds of Winter' makes the most of its extended run time, and is potentially the best season finale in the series' history.\" The episode had received a perfect 10 out of 10 score on IMDb for several weeks after its release. It now holds a rating of 9.9/10, being one of the few episodes ever to get a 9.9 or higher on the website. Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in his review for the episode \"The stories in the North and Meereen stayed a bit quiet as all their action got taken care of last week, leaving Cersei's big plot to destroy the Sept and everyone in it as this finale's big suspenseful and explosive set piece.",
