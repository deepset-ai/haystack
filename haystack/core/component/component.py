        component: Marks a class as a component. Any class decorated with `@component` can be used by a Pipeline.

    All components must follow the contract below. This docstring is the source of truth for components contract.

    <hr>

    `@component` decorator

    All component classes must be decorated with the `@component` decorator. This allows Canals to discover them.

    <hr>

    `__init__(self, **kwargs)`

    Optional method.

    Components may have an `__init__` method where they define:

    - `self.init_parameters = {same parameters that the __init__ method received}`:
        In this dictionary you can store any state the components wish to be persisted when they are saved.
        These values will be given to the `__init__` method of a new instance when the pipeline is loaded.
        Note that by default the `@component` decorator saves the arguments automatically.
        However, if a component sets their own `init_parameters` manually in `__init__()`, that will be used instead.
        Note: all of the values contained here **must be JSON serializable**. Serialize them manually if needed.

    Components should take only "basic" Python types as parameters of their `__init__` function, or iterables and
    dictionaries containing only such values. Anything else (objects, functions, etc) will raise an exception at init
    time. If there's the need for such values, consider serializing them to a string.

    _(TODO explain how to use classes and functions in init. In the meantime see `test/components/test_accumulate.py`)_

    The `__init__` must be extremely lightweight, because it's a frequent operation during the construction and
    validation of the pipeline. If a component has some heavy state to initialize (models, backends, etc...) refer to
    the `warm_up()` method.

    <hr>

    `warm_up(self)`

    Optional method.

    This method is called by Pipeline before the graph execution. Make sure to avoid double-initializations,
    because Pipeline will not keep track of which components it called `warm_up()` on.

    <hr>

    `run(self, data)`

    Mandatory method.

    This is the method where the main functionality of the component should be carried out. It's called by
    `Pipeline.run()`.

    When the component should run, Pipeline will call this method with an instance of the dataclass returned by the
    method decorated with `@component.input`. This dataclass contains:

    - all the input values coming from other components connected to it,
    - if any is missing, the corresponding value defined in `self.defaults`, if it exists.

    `run()` must return a single instance of the dataclass declared through the method decorated with
    `@component.output`.

    Note this is only used by type checking tools.

    In order to implement the `Component` protocol, custom components need to
    have a `run` method. The signature of the method and its return value
    won't be checked, i.e. classes with the following methods:

        def run(self, param: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
            ...

    and

        def run(self, **kwargs):
            ...

    will be both considered as respecting the protocol. This makes the type
    checking much weaker, but we have other places where we ensure code is
    dealing with actual Components.

    The protocol is runtime checkable so it'll be possible to assert:
