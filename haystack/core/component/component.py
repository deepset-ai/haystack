        component: Marks a class as a component. Any class decorated with `@component` can be used by a Pipeline.

    All components must follow the contract below. This docstring is the source of truth for components contract.

    <hr>

    `@component` decorator

    All component classes must be decorated with the `@component` decorator. This allows Canals to discover them.

    <hr>

    `__init__(self, **kwargs)`

    Optional method.

    Components may have an `__init__` method where they define:

    - `self.init_parameters = {same parameters that the __init__ method received}`:
        In this dictionary you can store any state the components wish to be persisted when they are saved.
        These values will be given to the `__init__` method of a new instance when the pipeline is loaded.
        Note that by default the `@component` decorator saves the arguments automatically.
        However, if a component sets their own `init_parameters` manually in `__init__()`, that will be used instead.
        Note: all of the values contained here **must be JSON serializable**. Serialize them manually if needed.

    Components should take only "basic" Python types as parameters of their `__init__` function, or iterables and
    dictionaries containing only such values. Anything else (objects, functions, etc) will raise an exception at init
    time. If there's the need for such values, consider serializing them to a string.

    _(TODO explain how to use classes and functions in init. In the meantime see `test/components/test_accumulate.py`)_

    The `__init__` must be extremely lightweight, because it's a frequent operation during the construction and
    validation of the pipeline. If a component has some heavy state to initialize (models, backends, etc...) refer to
    the `warm_up()` method.

    <hr>

    `warm_up(self)`

    Optional method.

    This method is called by Pipeline before the graph execution. Make sure to avoid double-initializations,
    because Pipeline will not keep track of which components it called `warm_up()` on.

    <hr>

    `run(self, data)`

    Mandatory method.

    This is the method where the main functionality of the component should be carried out. It's called by
    `Pipeline.run()`.

    When the component should run, Pipeline will call this method with an instance of the dataclass returned by the
    method decorated with `@component.input`. This dataclass contains:

    - all the input values coming from other components connected to it,
    - if any is missing, the corresponding value defined in `self.defaults`, if it exists.

    `run()` must return a single instance of the dataclass declared through the method decorated with
    `@component.output`.

    In order to implement the `Component` protocol, custom components need to

    checking much weaker, but we have other places where we ensure code is
