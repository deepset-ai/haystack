        :raises PipelineRuntimeError:
            If a component fails or returns unexpected output.

        Example a - Using named components:
        Consider a 'Hello' component that takes a 'word' input and outputs a greeting.

        ```python
        @component
        class Hello:
            @component.output_types(output=str)
            def run(self, word: str):
                return {"output": f"Hello, {word}!"}
        ```

        Create a pipeline with two 'Hello' components connected together:

        ```python
        pipeline = Pipeline()
        pipeline.add_component("hello", Hello())
        pipeline.add_component("hello2", Hello())
        pipeline.connect("hello.output", "hello2.word")
        result = pipeline.run(data={"hello": {"word": "world"}})
        ```

        This runs the pipeline with the specified input for 'hello', yielding
        {'hello2': {'output': 'Hello, Hello, world!!'}}.

        Example b - Using flat inputs:
        You can also pass inputs directly without specifying component names:

        ```python
        result = pipeline.run(data={"word": "world"})
        ```

        The pipeline resolves inputs to the correct components, returning
        {'hello2': {'output': 'Hello, Hello, world!!'}}.
