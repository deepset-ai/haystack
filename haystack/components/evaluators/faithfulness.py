class FaithfulnessEvaluator(LLMEvaluator):

    Evaluator that checks if a generated answer can be inferred from the provided contexts.

    An LLM separates the answer into multiple statements and checks whether the statement can be inferred from the
    context or not. The final score for the full answer is a number from 0.0 to 1.0. It represents the proportion of
    statements that can be inferred from the provided contexts.

    Usage example:
    ```python
    from haystack.components.evaluators import FaithfulnessEvaluator

    questions = ["Who created the Python language?"]
    contexts = [
        [
            "Python, created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its language constructs aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for both small and large-scale software projects."
