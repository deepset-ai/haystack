class DocumentSplitter:
    """
    Splits long documents into smaller chunks.

    This is a common preprocessing step during indexing. It helps Embedders create meaningful semantic representations
    and prevents exceeding language model context limits.

    The DocumentSplitter is compatible with the following DocumentStores:
    - [Astra](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/astradocumentstore)
    - [Chroma](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/chromadocumentstore) limited support, overlapping information is
      not stored
    - [Elasticsearch](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/elasticsearch-document-store)
    - [OpenSearch](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/opensearch-document-store)
    - [Pgvector](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pgvectordocumentstore)
    - [Pinecone](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/pinecone-document-store) limited support, overlapping
       information is not stored
    - [Qdrant](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/qdrant-document-store)
    - [Weaviate](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/weaviatedocumentstore)

    ### Usage example

    ```python
    from haystack import Document
    from haystack.components.preprocessors import DocumentSplitter

    doc = Document(content="Moonlight shimmered softly, wolves howled nearby, night enveloped everything.")

    splitter = DocumentSplitter(split_by="word", split_length=3, split_overlap=0)
