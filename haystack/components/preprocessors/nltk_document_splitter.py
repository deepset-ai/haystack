        Splits your documents using NLTK to respect sentence boundaries.

            `sentence` for splitting by NLTK sentence tokenizer, `page` for splitting by the form feed ("\\f") or
            `passage` for splitting by double line breaks ("\\n\\n").
        :param split_length: The maximum number of units in each split.
        :param split_overlap: The number of overlapping units for each split.
        :param split_threshold: The minimum number of units per split. If a split has fewer units
            than the threshold, it's attached to the previous split.
        :param respect_sentence_boundary: Choose whether to respect sentence boundaries when splitting by "word".
            If True, uses NLTK to detect sentence boundaries, ensuring splits occur only between sentences.
        :param language: Choose the language for the NLTK tokenizer. The default is English ("en").
        :param use_split_rules: Choose whether to use additional split rules when splitting by `sentence`.
        :param extend_abbreviations: Choose whether to extend NLTK's PunktTokenizer abbreviations with a list
            of curated abbreviations, if available.
            This is currently supported for English ("en") and German ("de").
        :param splitting_function: Necessary when `split_by` is set to "function".
            This is a function which must accept a single `str` as input and return a `list` of `str` as output,
            representing the chunks after splitting.
