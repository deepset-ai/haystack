class RecursiveDocumentSplitter:
    """
    Recursively chunk text into smaller chunks.

    This component is used to split text into smaller chunks, it does so by recursively applying a list of separators
    to the text.

    The separators are applied in the order they are provided, typically this is a list of separators that are
    applied in a specific order, being the last separator the most specific one.

    Each separator is applied to the text, it then checks each of the resulting chunks, it keeps the chunks that
    are within the chunk_size, for the ones that are larger than the chunk_size, it applies the next separator in the
    list to the remaining text.

    This is done until all chunks are smaller than the chunk_size parameter.

    Example:

    ```python
    from haystack import Document
    from haystack.components.preprocessors import RecursiveDocumentSplitter

    chunker = RecursiveDocumentSplitter(split_length=260, split_overlap=0, separators=["\n\n", "\n", ".", " "])
    text = '''Artificial intelligence (AI) - Introduction

    AI, in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems.
    AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications include advanced web search engines; recommendation systems; interacting via human speech; autonomous vehicles; generative and creative tools; and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games.'''

    doc = Document(content=text)
    doc_chunks = chunker.run([doc])
