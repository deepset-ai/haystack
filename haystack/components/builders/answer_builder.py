    Converts a query and Generator replies into a `GeneratedAnswer` object.

    AnswerBuilder parses Generator replies using custom regular expressions.
    Check out the usage example below to see how it works.
    Optionally, it can also take documents and metadata from the Generator to add to the `GeneratedAnswer` object.
    AnswerBuilder works with both non-chat and chat Generators.

    ### Usage example

    ```python
    from haystack.components.builders import AnswerBuilder

    builder = AnswerBuilder(pattern="Answer: (.*)")
    builder.run(query="What's the answer?", replies=["This is an argument. Answer: This is the answer."])
    ```

        reference_pattern: Optional[str] = None,
        last_message_only: bool = False,
        *,
        return_only_referenced_documents: bool = True,
    ):
        """
        Creates an instance of the AnswerBuilder component.

        :param pattern:
            The regular expression pattern to extract the answer text from the Generator.
            If not specified, the entire response is used as the answer.
            The regular expression can have one capture group at most.
            If present, the capture group text
            is used as the answer. If no capture group is present, the whole match is used as the answer.
            Examples:
                `[^\\n]+$` finds "this is an answer" in a string "this is an argument.\\nthis is an answer".
                `Answer: (.*)` finds "this is an answer" in a string "this is an argument. Answer: this is an answer".

        :param reference_pattern:
            The regular expression pattern used for parsing the document references.
            If not specified, no parsing is done, and all documents are returned.
            References need to be specified as indices of the input documents and start at [1].
            Example: `\\[(\\d+)\\]` finds "1" in a string "this is an answer[1]".
            If this parameter is provided, documents metadata will contain a "referenced" key with a boolean value.

        :param last_message_only:
           If False (default value), all messages are used as the answer.
           If True, only the last message is used as the answer.

        :param return_only_referenced_documents:
            To be used in conjunction with `reference_pattern`.
            If True (default value), only the documents that were actually referenced in `replies` are returned.
            If False, all documents are returned.
            If `reference_pattern` is not provided, this parameter has no effect, and all documents are returned.
