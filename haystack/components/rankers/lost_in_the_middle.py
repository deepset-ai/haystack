class LostInTheMiddleRanker:
    """
    Ranks documents based on the 'lost in the middle' order so that the most relevant documents are either at the
    beginning or end, while the least relevant are in the middle.

    LostInTheMiddleRanker assumes that some prior component in the pipeline has already ranked documents by relevance
    and requires no query as input but only documents. It is typically used as the last component before building a
    prompt for an LLM to prepare the input context for the LLM.

    Lost in the Middle ranking lays out document contents into LLM context so that the most relevant contents are at
    the beginning or end of the input context, while the least relevant is in the middle of the context. See the
    paper ["Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) for more
    details.

    Usage example:
    ```python
    from haystack.components.rankers import LostInTheMiddleRanker
    from haystack import Document

    ranker = LostInTheMiddleRanker()
    docs = [Document(content="Paris"), Document(content="Berlin"), Document(content="Madrid")]
    result = ranker.run(documents=docs)
    for doc in result["documents"]:
        print(doc.content)
    ```
