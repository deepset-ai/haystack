    OpenAPIServiceConnector connects to OpenAPI services, allowing for the invocation of methods specified in
    an OpenAPI specification of that service. It integrates with ChatMessage interface, where messages are used to
    determine the method to be called and the parameters to be passed. The message payload should be a JSON formatted
    string consisting of the method name and the parameters to be passed to the method. The method name and parameters
    are then used to invoke the method on the OpenAPI service. The response from the service is returned as a
    ChatMessage.

    Before using this component, one needs to register functions from the OpenAPI specification with LLM.
    This can be done using the OpenAPIServiceToFunctions component.
