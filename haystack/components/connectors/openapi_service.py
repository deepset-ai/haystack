@component
class OpenAPIServiceConnector:
    """
    A component which connects the Haystack framework to OpenAPI services.

    The `OpenAPIServiceConnector` component connects the Haystack framework to OpenAPI services, enabling it to call
    operations as defined in the OpenAPI specification of the service.

    It integrates with `ChatMessage` dataclass, where the payload in messages is used to determine the method to be
    called and the parameters to be passed. The message payload should be an OpenAI JSON formatted function calling
    string consisting of the method name and the parameters to be passed to the method. The method name and parameters
    are then used to invoke the method on the OpenAPI service. The response from the service is returned as a
    `ChatMessage`.

    Before using this component, users usually resolve service endpoint parameters with a help of
    `OpenAPIServiceToFunctions` component.

    The example below demonstrates how to use the `OpenAPIServiceConnector` to invoke a method on a https://serper.dev/
    service specified via OpenAPI specification.

    Note, however, that `OpenAPIServiceConnector` is usually not meant to be used directly, but rather as part of a
    pipeline that includes the `OpenAPIServiceToFunctions` component and an `OpenAIChatGenerator` component using LLM
    with the function calling capabilities. In the example below we use the function calling payload directly, but in a
    real-world scenario, the function calling payload would usually be generated by the `OpenAIChatGenerator` component.

    Usage example:

    ```python
    import json
    import requests

    from haystack.components.connectors import OpenAPIServiceConnector
    from haystack.dataclasses import ChatMessage


    fc_payload = [{'function': {'arguments': '{"q": "Why was Sam Altman ousted from OpenAI?"}', 'name': 'search'},
                   'id': 'call_PmEBYvZ7mGrQP5PUASA5m9wO', 'type': 'function'}]

    serper_token = <your_serper_dev_token>
    serperdev_openapi_spec = json.loads(requests.get("https://bit.ly/serper_dev_spec").text)
    service_connector = OpenAPIServiceConnector()
    result = service_connector.run(messages=[ChatMessage.from_assistant(json.dumps(fc_payload))],
                                   service_openapi_spec=serperdev_openapi_spec, service_credentials=serper_token)
    print(result)

    >> {'service_response': [ChatMessage(content='{"searchParameters": {"q": "Why was Sam Altman ousted from OpenAI?",
    >> "type": "search", "engine": "google"}, "answerBox": {"snippet": "Concerns over AI safety and OpenAI\'s role
    >> in protecting were at the center of Altman\'s brief ouster from the company."...
