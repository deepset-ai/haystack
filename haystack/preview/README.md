Since Haystack 1.15, weâ€™ve been slowly introducing new components and features to Haystack in the background in preparation for Haystack 2.0. In this `preview` module, you can find whatâ€™s been implemented so far regarding Haystack 2.0. **Keep in mind that Haystack 2.0 is still a work in progress.** Read more about Haystack 2.0 in [Shaping Haystack 2.0](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/discussions/5568).

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

**Install `haystack-ai`**

There is a separate PyPI package that only ships the code in `preview` module. You can install `haystack-ai` using pip:
```sh
pip install haystack-ai
```
The `haystack-ai` package is built on the `main` branch, so it's highly unstable, but it's useful if you want to try the new features as soon as they are merged.

**Install `farm-haystack`**

As an alternative way, you can install `farm-haystack`:
```sh
pip install farm-haystack
```
The `farm-haystack` package includes all new features of Haystack 2.0. Note that updates to this package occur less frequently compared to `haystack-ai`. So, you might not get the all latest Haystack 2.0 features immediately when using `farm-haystack`.
