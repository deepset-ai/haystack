        Filters are defined as nested dictionaries that can be of two types:
        - Comparison
        - Logic

        Comparison dictionaries must contain the keys:

        - `field`
        - `operator`
        - `value`

        Logic dictionaries must contain the keys:

        - `operator`
        - `conditions`

        The `conditions` key must be a list of dictionaries, either of type Comparison or Logic.

        The `operator` value in Comparison dictionaries must be one of:

        - `==`
        - `!=`
        - `>`
        - `>=`
        - `<`
        - `<=`
        - `in`
        - `not in`

        The `operator` values in Logic dictionaries must be one of:

        - `NOT`
        - `OR`
        - `AND`
