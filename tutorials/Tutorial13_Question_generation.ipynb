Their musical stylings have been compared to Wire, Magazine and Joy Division.[4] The band released their debut single, 'Magic of Meghan' in 2019. Shaw wrote the song after going through a break-up and moving out of her former partner's apartment the same day that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced they were engaged.[5] This was followed by the release of two EPs that year: Sweet Princess in August and Boundary Road Snacks and Drinks in October. The band were included as part of the NME 100 of 2020,[6] as well as DIY magazine's Class of 2020.[7] The band signed to 4AD in late 2020 and shared a new single, 'Scratchcard Lanyard'.[8] In February 2021, the band shared details of their debut studio album, New Long Leg. They also shared the single 'Strong Feelings'.[9] The album, which was produced by John Parish, was released on 2 April 2021.[10]\"\n",
