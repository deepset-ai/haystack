    "\n",
    "1. **Annotation**: You can use the [annotation tool](https://haystack.deepset.ai/guides/annotation) to label your data, i.e. highlighting answers to your questions in a document. The tool supports structuring your workflow with organizations, projects, and users. The labels can be exported in SQuAD format that is compatible for training with Haystack.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Feedback**: For production systems, you can collect training data from direct user feedback via Haystack's [REST API interface](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack#rest-api). This includes a customizable user feedback API for providing feedback on the answer returned by the API. The API provides a feedback export endpoint to obtain the feedback data for fine-tuning your model further.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fine-tune your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have collected training data, you can fine-tune your base models.\n",
    "We initialize a reader as a base model and fine-tune it on our own custom dataset (should be in SQuAD-like format).\n",
    "We recommend using a base model that was trained on SQuAD or a similar QA dataset before to benefit from Transfer Learning effects.\n",

    "**Recommendation**: Run training on a GPU.\n",
