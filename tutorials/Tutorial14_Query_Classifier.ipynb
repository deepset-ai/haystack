    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/master/tutorials/Tutorial14_Query_Classifier.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great benefits of using state-of-the-art NLP models like those available in Haystack is that it allows users to state their queries as *plain natural language questions*: rather than trying to come up with just the right set of keywords to find the answer to their question, users can simply ask their question in much the same way that they would ask it of a (very knowledgeable!) person.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just because users *can* ask their questions in \"plain English\" (or \"plain German\", etc.), that doesn't mean they always *will*. For instance, a user might input a few keywords rather than a complete question because they don't understand the pipeline's full capabilities, or because they are so accustomed to keyword search. While a standard Haystack pipeline might handle such queries with reasonable accuracy, for a variety of reasons we still might prefer that our pipeline be sensitive to the type of query it is receiving, so that it behaves differently when a user inputs, say, a collection of keywords instead of a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, Haystack comes with built-in capabilities to distinguish between three types of queries: **keyword queries**, **interrogative queries**, and **statement queries**, described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keyword queries** can be thought of more or less as lists of words, such as \"Alaska cruises summer\". While the meanings of individual words may matter in a keyword query, the linguistic connections *between* words do not. Hence, in a keyword query the order of words is largely irrelevant: \"Alaska cruises summer\", \"summer Alaska cruises\", and \"summer cruises Alaska\" are functionally the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interrogative queries** (or **question queries**) are queries phrased as natural language questions, such as \"Who was the father of Eddard Stark?\". Unlike with keyword queries, word order very much matters here: \"Who was the father of Eddard Stark?\" and \"Who was Eddard Stark the father of?\" are very different questions, despite having exactly the same words. (Note that while we often write questions with question marks, Haystack can find interrogative queries without such a dead giveaway!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statement queries** are just declarative sentences, such as \"Daenerys loved Jon\". These are like interrogative queries in that word order matters&mdash;again, \"Daenerys loved Jon\" and \"Jon loved Daenerys\" mean very different things&mdash;but they are statements instead of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to use **query classifiers** to branch your Haystack pipeline based on the type of query it receives. Haystack comes with two out-of-the-box query classification schemas, each of which routes a given query into one of two branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keyword vs. Question/Statement** &mdash; routes a query into one of two branches depending on whether it is a full question/statement or a collection of keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Question vs. Statement** &mdash; routes a natural language query into one of two branches depending on whether it is a question or a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for each classification schema there are two types of nodes capable of performing this classification: a **`TransformersQueryClassifier`** that uses a transformer model, and an **`SklearnQueryClassifier`** that uses a more lightweight model built in `sklearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of that explanation out of the way, let's dive in!"

    "\n",
    "To make things more concrete, our pipeline will start with a retriever, which is then fed into a `TransformersQueryClassifier` that is set to do question vs. statement classification. Note that this means we need to explicitly choose the model, since as mentioned previously a default `TransformersQueryClassifier` performs keyword vs. question/statement classification. The classifier's first branch, which handles question queries, will then be sent to the reader, while the second branch will not be connected to any other nodes. As a result, the last node of the pipeline depends on the type of query: questions go all the way through the reader, while statements only go through the retriever. This pipeline is illustrated below:"
