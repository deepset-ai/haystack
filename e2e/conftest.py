    Delete Hugging Face environment variables for tests.

    Prevents passing empty tokens to Hugging Face, which would cause API calls to fail.
    This is particularly relevant for PRs opened from forks, where secrets are not available
    and empty environment variables might be set instead of being removed.

    See https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/issues/8811 for more details.
